<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Every one who wishes to understand and rightly
estimate the Methodist movement of the last century,
must, not only read the lives of the two Wesleys, but also,
make himself acquainted with the history of Whitefield, and
the career of the Methodist contemporaries of the illustrious
trio.</p>

<p>John Wesley was Methodism's founder, and Charles its
hymnologist. John Clayton became a man of mark among
the High Church clergymen of the Episcopal Communion.
James Hervey belonged to the Evangelical section of the
Church of England, and, by his writings, influenced not a
few of the country's aristocracy. Benjamin Ingham, by his
preaching, left a deep impress on Yorkshire, and other parts
of the North of England. John Gambold rendered inestimable
service, in moderating and correcting the extravagances
of the Moravian Brotherhood. Thomas Broughton gave an
impetus to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge,
which is felt to the present day. Richard Hutchins, as
Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford, helped to mould the
character of students, who afterwards rose to great distinction.
To each of these distinguished men, Providence assigned a
sphere of unusual usefulness. They moved in different
orbits, but all were made a blessing to the world.</p>

<p>George Whitefield was pre-eminently the outdoor preacher;&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
most popular evangelist of the age;&mdash;a roving revivalist,&mdash;who,
with unequalled eloquence and power, spent above thirty
years in testifying to enormous crowds, in Great Britain and
America, the gospel of the grace of God. Practically, he
belonged to no denomination of Christians, but was the friend
of all. His labours, popularity, and success were marvellous,
perhaps unparalleled. All churches in England, Wales,
Scotland, and the British settlements in America, were
permanently benefited by his piety, his example, and the
few great truths which he continually preached; whilst the
Methodism organised by his friend Wesley&mdash;especially in
the northern counties of the kingdom&mdash;was, by his itinerant
services, promoted to a far greater extent than the Methodists
have ever yet acknowledged.</p>

<p>The world has a right to know all that can be told of such
a man. To say nothing of almost innumerable sketches, at
least half a dozen lives of Whitefield have been already
published. If the reader asks why I have dared to add to the
number of these biographies? I answer, because I possessed
a large amount of biographical material which previous
biographers had not employed, and much of which seems to
have been unknown to them. This is not an empty boast,
as will be evident to every one who compares the present
work with the lives of Whitefield which have preceded it.</p>

<p>In collecting materials for the "Life and Times of Wesley,"
and for the "Oxford Methodists," I met with much concerning
Whitefield; and, since then, I have spared neither time,
toil, nor money in making further researches relating to the
great evangelist. With the exception of a few instances, all
of which are acknowledged, my facts are taken from original
sources; and, though to say so may savour of vanity, I believe
there is now no information concerning Whitefield, of any
public importance, which is not contained in the present
volumes.</p>

<p>I have been obliged to employ a few of Whitefield's letters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
which I had previously published in the "Life and Times of
Wesley." This was unavoidable; but the repetition is
extremely limited, and is never used except when justice
made it necessary.</p>

<p>Whitefield was a Calvinist: I am an Arminian; but the
book is not controversial. Whitefield's sentiments and language
have been honestly and truly quoted; and I have not
attempted to refute his theological opinions. On such subjects,
men, at present, must agree to differ.</p>

<p>The Life is not written with special regard to the interests
of any Church whatever,&mdash;Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Independent,
Baptist, or even Methodist. Whitefield, indeed,
called himself a member and minister of the Church of
England; but, in reality, he belonged to the Church Catholic.
He loved all who loved Jesus Christ, and was always ready
to be their fellow-labourer. It is right to add, however, that,
as a matter of fact, I have felt bound to shew that the friendship
between Whitefield and the Wesleys was much more
loving and constant than it has been represented by previous
biographers; and that Whitefield's services to Methodism
were more important than the public generally have imagined.</p>

<p>Without the least desire to depreciate any of the lives of
Whitefield already published, I may be allowed to say, they are
not without errors. Instead, however, of confuting the errors,
one by one, as I have met with them, I have, as a rule, not
noticed them; but have simply narrated facts, bearing on the
respective cases, without comment and without colouring.</p>

<p>The foot-notes are more numerous than I like, and this
has prevented my adding to their number by giving <em>all</em> the
references for the statements I have made; but, if the truthfulness
of any statement be called in question, it will be an
easy task to adduce the authority in support of it. For the
notices of American ministers and gentlemen, I am chiefly
indebted to the "Biographical and Historical Dictionary" of
the Rev. William Allen, D.D., President of Bowdoin College,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
and Member of the Historical Society of Maine, New Hampshire,
and New York.</p>

<p>The book is neither artistic nor philosophic. I have merely
done my utmost to collect information concerning Whitefield,
and have related the facts as clearly, concisely, and honestly
as I could. I have also, as far as possible, acted upon the
principle of making Whitefield his own biographer. Perhaps,
I ought to apologise for the introduction of such lengthened
details concerning the first few years of Whitefield's public
life. Apart from being influenced by the fact, that, it
was during this eventful period that Whitefield's character
was formed, and his unique mission among men determined,
I was wishful to give to the Christian Church, at least, the
<em>substance</em> of his Journals&mdash;Journals which, unlike those of his
friend Wesley, have never been republished, and which, in
consequence of their rareness, are almost quite unknown.</p>

<p>The two portraits are copied from original engravings,
which Dr. Gillies, Whitefield's friend and first biographer,
pronounced the most exact likenesses of the great preacher
ever published.</p>

<p>Whitefield's power was not in his talents, nor even in his
oratory, but in his piety. In some respects, he has had no
successors; but in prayer, in faith, in religious experience, in
devotedness to God, and in a bold and steadfast declaration of
the few great Christian truths which aroused the churches
and created Methodism,&mdash;he may have many. May Whitefield's
God raise them up, and thrust them out! The Church
and the world greatly need them.</p>

OF<br />

<span class="smcap">The</span> REV. GEORGE WHITEFIELD, B.A.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><em>WHITEFIELD'S BOYHOOD.</em></h2>

<h3>1714 TO 1732.</h3>


<p>George Whitefield was born in the Bell Inn,
Gloucester, on the 16th day of December (O.S.),
1714.</p>

<p>His genealogy, as given by his first biographer, Dr. Gillies,
is brief, but not without interest:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Rev. Mr. Samuel Whitefield, great-grandfather of George, was
born at Wantage, and was rector of North Ledyard,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in Wiltshire. He
removed afterwards to Rockhampton, in Gloucestershire. He had five
daughters&mdash;two of whom were married to clergymen, Mr. Perkins and Mr.
Lovingham; and two sons&mdash;Samuel, who succeeded his father in the cure
of Rockhampton, and died without issue; and Andrew, who was a private
gentleman, and lived retired upon his estate. Andrew had fourteen children,
of whom Thomas was the eldest.</p>

<p>"Thomas was first bred to the employment of a wine-merchant in Bristol,
but afterwards kept the Bell Inn, in the city of Gloucester. In Bristol he
married Elizabeth Edwards, who was related to the Blackwells and the
Dimours of that city; by whom he had six sons and one daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>"Elizabeth, the daughter, was twice reputably married at Bristol. John
lies interred with the family in St. Mary de Crypt Church, in Gloucester.
Joseph died an infant. Andrew settled in trade at Bristol, and died in the
twenty-eighth year of his age. James was captain of a ship, and died
suddenly at Bath. George was the youngest of the family, and, at his
death, left two surviving brothers, Thomas and Richard.</p>

<p>"The father died in December, 1716, when George was only two years
old. The mother continued a widow seven years, and was then married
to Mr. Longden, an ironmonger in Gloucester, by whom she had no issue.
She died in December, 1751, in the seventy-first year of her age."</p></blockquote>

<p>So much for pedigree. Though Whitefield's ancestry was
far from aristocratic, it was not ignoble.</p>

<p>Nothing is known of the years of Whitefield's boyhood,
except what is furnished by himself. In the year 1740, he
published an octavo pamphlet of seventy-six pages, entitled
"A Short Account of God's Dealings with the Reverend Mr.
George Whitefield, A.B., Late of Pembroke College, Oxford:
from his Infancy to the Time of his entering into Holy
Orders." This was written on board the <em>Elizabeth</em>, during
his first voyage to America, and contains not a few unguarded
and objectionable expressions&mdash;expressions which brought
upon him the ridicule of his enemies, and which he himself
afterwards regretted. In 1756, he "revised, corrected, and
abridged" this imprudent publication; and, in the Preface,
confessed that "many mistakes were rectified," and "many
passages, that were justly exceptionable, erased."</p>

<p>In the present work, Whitefield, as far as possible, is
made to be his own biographer; and though, perhaps, it is
scarcely fair to print again what he himself erased, yet, as
the sentences and paragraphs which he subsequently omitted
were the occasion of many of the virulent attacks made
upon him by his earliest opponents, these attacks cannot
be properly understood without the text from which they
had their origin.</p>

<p>Besides this, the publication in question is now extremely
scarce. Not one in a thousand of Whitefield's admirers
has ever seen it. It has never been re-published in its
entirety since it was first issued, in the year 1740. It
exhibits, not only Whitefield's honesty, but his weaknesses
and faults, at the early age of twenty-five; and, without it,
the reader cannot have a full and correct conception of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Whitefield's character at the commencement of his marvelous
and illustrious career.</p>

<p>For such reasons, the pamphlet of 1740 is here given in
its completeness, without abridgment and without revision.
The words and passages, however, which he himself, in
1756, altered or erased, will be marked by being enclosed
in brackets, or by notes.</p>

<p>Another remark must be added. What Whitefield says
of his boyhood's wickedness must be received with caution.
To exalt the grace of God in his conversion, he seemed
desirous to magnify his own depravity and sin. Without
intentional exaggeration, he, perhaps, makes himself
worse than he really was. At all events, the following extract
from his preface deserves attention:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the accounts of good men which I have read, I have observed
that the writers of them have been partial. They have given us the
bright, but not the dark side of their character. This, I think, proceeded
from a kind of pious fraud, lest mentioning persons' faults should encourage
others in sin. It cannot, I am sure, proceed from the wisdom which
cometh from above. The sacred writers give an account of their failings
as well as their virtues. Peter is not ashamed to confess that, with oaths
and curses, he thrice denied his Master; nor do the Evangelists make
any scruple of telling us, that out of Mary Magdalene Jesus Christ cast
seven devils.</p>

<p>"I have, therefore, endeavoured to follow their good example. I have
simply told what I was by nature, as well as what I am by grace. I am
not over cautious as to any supposed consequences, since none can be
hurt by these but such as hold the truth in unrighteousness. To the
pure all things will be pure.</p>

<p>"As I have often wished, when in my best frames, that the first years
of my life might be put down as a blank, and had no more in remembrance,
so I could almost wish now to pass them over in silence. But
as they will, in some degree, illustrate God's dealings with me in my
riper years, I shall, as I am able, give the following brief account of
them."</p></blockquote>

<p>After this exordium, which the reader will find useful in
interpreting what follows, Whitefield proceeds with the first
section of his autobiography.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was born in Gloucester, in the month of December, 1714. [My
father and mother kept the Bell Inn. The former died when I was two
years old; the latter is now alive, and has often told me how she endured
fourteen weeks' sickness after she brought me into the world; but was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
used to say, even when I was an infant, that she expected more comfort
from me than any other of her children. This, with the circumstance of
my being born in an inn, has been often of service to me in exciting my
endeavours to make good my mother's expectations, and so follow the
example of my dear Saviour, who was born in a manger belonging to an
inn.</p>

<p>"My very infant years must necessarily not be mentioned; yet, I can
remember such early stirrings of corruption in my heart, as abundantly
convinces me that I was conceived and born in sin,&mdash;that in me dwelleth
no good thing by nature, and that if God had not freely prevented me by
His grace, I must have been for ever banished from His presence.]</p>

<p>"I can truly say, I was froward from my mother's womb. I was so
brutish as to hate instruction, and used purposely to shun all opportunities
of receiving it. I can date some very early acts of uncleanness. [I
soon gave pregnant proofs of an impudent temper.] Lying, filthy talking,
and foolish jesting I was much addicted to [even when very young]. Sometimes
I used to curse, if not swear. Stealing from my mother I thought
no theft at all, and used to make no scruple of taking money out of her
pocket before she was up. I have frequently betrayed my trust, and
have more than once spent money I took in the house, in buying fruits,
tarts, etc., to satisfy my sensual appetite. Numbers of Sabbaths have I
broken, and generally used to behave myself very irreverently in God's
sanctuary. Much money have I spent in plays, and in the common
entertainments of the age. Cards and reading romances were my
heart's delight. Often have I joined with others in playing roguish
tricks, but was generally, if not always, <em>happily detected</em>. For this, I have
often since, and do now, bless and praise God.</p>

<p>"It would be endless to recount the sins and offences of my younger
days. They are more in number than the hairs of my head. My heart
would fail me at the remembrance of them, was I not assured that my
Redeemer liveth, ever to make intercession for me. However the young
man in the Gospel might boast how he had kept the commandments from
his youth, with shame and confusion of face I confess that I have broken
them all from my youth. Whatever foreseen fitness for salvation others
may talk of and glory in, I disclaim any such thing. If I trace myself
from my cradle to my manhood, I can see nothing in me but a fitness to
be damned. [I speak the truth in Christ, I lie not.] If the Almighty had
not prevented me by His grace, and wrought most powerfully upon my
soul, quickening me by His free Spirit when dead in trespasses and sins,
I had now been either sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death, or
condemned, as the due reward of my crimes, to be for ever lifting up my
eyes in torments.</p>

<p>"But such was the free grace of God to me, that though corruption
worked so strongly in my soul, and produced such early and bitter fruits,
yet I can recollect very early movings of the blessed Spirit upon my heart,
sufficient to satisfy me that God loved me with an everlasting love, and
separated me even from my mother's womb for the work to which He afterwards
was pleased to call me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>"I had some early convictions of sin; and once, I remember, when some
persons, as they frequently did, made it their business to tease me, I
immediately retired to my room, and kneeling down, with many tears,
prayed over that psalm wherein David so often repeats these words&mdash;'<em>But
in the name of the Lord will I destroy them.</em>' I was always fond of being
a clergyman, and used frequently to imitate the ministers reading prayers,
etc. Part of the money I used to steal from my parent I gave to the poor,
and some books I privately took from others, for which I have since
restored fourfold, I remember were books of devotion.</p>

<p>"My mother was very careful of my education, and always kept me in
my tender years [for which I never can sufficiently thank her] from intermeddling
in the least with the public business.</p>

<p>"About the tenth year of my age, it pleased God to permit my mother
to marry a second time. It proved what the world would call an unhappy
match as for temporals, but God overruled it for good. [It set my brethren
upon thinking more than otherwise they would have done, and made an
uncommon impression upon my own heart in particular.]</p>

<p>"When I was about twelve, I was placed at a school called St. Mary
de Crypt, in Gloucester&mdash;the last grammar school I ever went to. Having
a good elocution and memory, I was remarked for making speeches before
the Corporation, at their annual visitation.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But I cannot say I felt any
drawings of God upon my soul for a year or two, saving that I laid out
some of the money that was given me, on one of those forementioned
occasions, in buying Ken's 'Manual for Winchester Scholars'&mdash;a book
that had much affected me when my brother used to read it in my mother's
troubles, and which, for some time after I bought it, was of great benefit
to my soul.</p>

<p>"During the time of my being at school, I was very fond of reading
plays, and have kept from school for days together to prepare myself
for acting them. My master, seeing how mine and my schoolfellows'
vein ran, composed something of this kind for us himself, and caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
me to dress myself in girl's clothes, which I had often done, to act
a part before the Corporation. The remembrance of this has often
covered me with confusion of face, and I hope will do so, even to the end
of my life.</p>

<p>["And I cannot but here observe, with much concern of mind, how this
way of training up youth has a natural tendency to debauch the mind, to
raise ill passions, and to stuff the memory with things as contrary to the
Gospel of Jesus Christ as light to darkness, heaven to hell. However,
though the first thing I had to repent of was my education in general, yet
I must always acknowledge my particular thanks are due to my master, for
the great pains he took with me and his other scholars, in teaching us to
speak and write correctly.]</p>

<p>"Before I was fifteen, having, as I thought, made a sufficient progress
in the classics, and, at the bottom, longing to be set at liberty from the confinement
of a school, I one day told my mother, 'Since her circumstances
would not permit her to give me an University education, more learning I
thought would spoil me for a tradesman; and, therefore, I judged it best
not to learn Latin any longer.' She at first refused to consent, but my
corruptions soon got the better of her good nature. Hereupon, for some
time, I went to learn to write only. But my mother's circumstances being
much on the decline, and being tractable that way, I from time to time
began to assist her occasionally in the public-house, till at length I put
on my blue apron and my snuffers,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> washed mops, cleaned rooms, and,
in one word, became professed and common drawer for nigh a year and
a half.</p>

<p>"[But He who was with David when he was following the sheep big with
young, was with me even here. For] notwithstanding I was thus employed
in a common inn, and had sometimes the care of the whole house upon
my hands, yet I composed two or three sermons, and dedicated one of
them in particular to my elder brother. One time, I remember, I was
much pressed to self-examination, and found myself very unwilling to look
into my heart. Frequently I read the Bible when sitting up at night.
Seeing the boys go by to school has often cut me to the heart. And a dear
youth, now with God, would often come entreating me, when serving at
the bar, to go to Oxford. My general answer was, 'I wish I could.'</p>

<p>"After I had continued about a year in this servile employment, my
mother was obliged to leave the inn. My brother, who had been bred up
for the business, married; whereupon all was made over to him; and,
I being accustomed to the house, it was agreed that I should continue
there as an assistant. [But God's thoughts were not as our thoughts.</p>

<p>"By His good Providence] it happened that my sister-in-law and I
could by no means agree; [and at length the resentment grew to such an
height, that my proud heart would scarce suffer me to speak to her for
three weeks together. But notwithstanding I was much to blame, yet I
used to retire and weep before the Lord, as Hagar when flying from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
mistress Sarah&mdash;little thinking that God by this means was forcing me out
of the public business, and calling me from drawing wine for drunkards,
to draw water out of the wells of salvation for the refreshment of His
spiritual Israel.]</p>

<p>"After continuing for a long while under this burden of mind, I
at length resolved, thinking my absence would make all things easy,
to go away. Accordingly, by the advice of my brother and consent
of my mother, I went to see my elder brother, then settled at Bristol.</p>

<p>"Here God was pleased to give me great foretastes of His love,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and fill
me with such unspeakable raptures, particularly once in St. John's Church,
that I was carried out beyond myself. I felt great hungerings and thirstings
after the blessed Sacrament, and wrote many letters to my mother, telling
her I would never go into the public employment again. Thomas à
Kempis was my great delight, and I was always impatient till the bell
rang to call me to tread the courts of the Lord's house. But in
the midst of these illuminations, something surely whispered, 'This will
not last.'</p>

<p>"And, indeed, so it happened. For&mdash;oh that I could write it in tears
of blood!&mdash;when I left Bristol, as I did in about two months, and
returned to Gloucester, I changed my devotion with my place. Alas!
all my fervour went off: I had no inclination to go to church, or draw
nigh unto God. In short, my heart, though I had so lately tasted of His
love, was far from Him.</p>

<p>"However, I had so much religion left, as to persist in my resolution
not to live in the inn; and therefore my mother gave me leave, though
she had but a little income, to have a bed upon the ground, and live at her
house, till Providence should point out a place for me.</p>

<p>"Having now, as I thought, nothing to do, it was a proper season
for Satan to tempt me. Much of my time I spent in reading plays, and
in sauntering from place to place. I was careful to adorn my body, but
took little pains to deck and beautify my soul. Evil communications
with my old schoolfellows soon corrupted my good manners. By seeing
their evil practices, the sense of the Divine presence<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> I had vouchsafed
unto me insensibly wore off my mind, and I at length fell into abominable
secret sin, the dismal effects of which I have felt, and groaned under ever
since.</p>

<p>"[But God, whose gifts and callings are without repentance, would let
nothing pluck me out of His hands, though I was continually doing despite
to the Spirit of Grace. He saw me with pity and compassion, when
lying in my blood. He passed by me; He said unto me, Live; and even
gave me some foresight of His providing for me.</p>

<p>"One morning, as I was reading a play to my sister, said I, 'God
intends something for me which we know not of. As I have been diligent
in business, I believe many would gladly have me for an apprentice, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
every way seems to be barred up, so that I think God will provide for me
some way or other that we cannot apprehend.'</p>

<p>"How I came to say these words I know not. God afterwards showed
me they came from Him.] Having thus lived with my mother for some
considerable time, a young student, who was once my schoolfellow, and
then a servitor of Pembroke College, Oxford, came to pay my mother
a visit. Amongst other conversation, he told her how he had discharged
all college expenses that quarter, and received a penny. Upon that my
mother immediately cried out, 'This will do for my son.' Then, turning
to me, she said, 'Will you go to Oxford, George?' I replied, 'With
all my heart.' Whereupon, having the same friends that this young
student had, my mother, without delay, waited on them. They promised
their interest to get me a servitor's place in the same college. She then
applied to my old master, who much approved of my coming to school
again.</p>

<p>"In about a week I went and re-entered myself, [and being grown much
in stature, my master addressed me thus: 'I see, George, you are advanced
in stature, but your better part must needs have gone backwards.' This
made me blush. He set me something to translate into Latin; and
though I had made no application to my classics for so long a time, yet I
had but one inconsiderable fault in my exercises. This, I believe, somewhat
surprised my master then, and has afforded me matter of thanks and
praise ever since.</p>

<p>"Being re-settled at school, I spared no pains to go forward in my
book.] God was pleased to give me His blessing, and I learned much
faster than I did before. But all this while I continued in [secret] sin;
and, at length, got acquainted with such a set of debauched, abandoned,
atheistical youths, that if God, by His free, unmerited, and especial grace,
had not delivered me out of their hands, I should long since have sat in
the scorner's chair [and made a mock at sin]. By keeping company
with them, my thoughts of religion grew more and more like theirs. I
went to public service only to make sport and walk about. I took pleasure
in their lewd conversation. I began to reason as they did [and to
ask why God had given me passions, and not permitted me to gratify
them? Not considering that God did not originally give us these <em>corrupt</em>
passions, and that He had promised help to withstand them, if we would
ask it of Him. In short, I soon made a great proficiency in the school of
the devil. I affected to look rakish], and was in a fair way of being as
infamous as the worst of them.</p>

<p>"But, oh stupendous love! God even here stopped me, when running
on in a full career to hell. For, just as I was upon the brink of ruin, He
gave me such a distaste of their principles and practices, that I discovered
them to my master, who soon put a stop to their proceedings.</p>

<p>"Being thus delivered out of the snare of the devil, I began to be more
and more serious, and felt God, at different times, working powerfully
and convincingly upon my soul. One day in particular, as I was coming
downstairs, and overheard my friends speaking well of me, God so deeply
convinced me of hypocrisy, that, though I had formed frequent but ineffectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
resolutions before, yet I had then power given me over my secret
and darling sin. Notwithstanding, some time after being overtaken in
liquor, as I have been twice or thrice in my lifetime, Satan gained his
usual advantage over me again,&mdash;an experimental proof to my poor soul,
how that wicked one makes use of men as machines, working them up to
just what he pleases [when by intemperance they have chased away the
Spirit of God from them].</p>

<p>"Being now near the seventeenth year of my age, I was resolved to
prepare myself for the holy sacrament, which I received on Christmas
Day. I began now to be more and more watchful over my thoughts,
words, and actions. I kept the following Lent, fasting Wednesday and
Friday, thirty-six hours together. My evenings, when I had done waiting
upon my mother, were generally spent in acts of devotion, reading
'Drelincourt on Death,' and other practical books, and I constantly went
to public worship twice a day. Being now upper-boy, by God's help, I
made some reformation amongst my schoolfellows. I was very diligent
in reading and learning the classics, and in studying my Greek Testament,
but was not yet convinced of the absolute unlawfulness of playing
at cards, and of reading and seeing plays, though I began to have some
scruples about it.</p>

<p>"Near this time, I dreamed that I was to see God on Mount Sinai, but
was afraid to meet Him. This made a great impression upon me; and
a gentlewoman to whom I told it said, 'George, this is a call from
God.'</p>

<p>["Still I grew more serious after this dream; but yet hypocrisy crept
into every action. As once I affected to look more rakish, I now strove
to appear more grave than I really was. However, an uncommon concern
and alteration were visible in my behaviour, and I often used to find fault
with the lightness of others.</p>

<p>"One night, as I was going on an errand for my mother, an unaccountable
but very strong impression was made upon my heart that I should
preach quickly. When I came home, I innocently told my mother what had
befallen me; but she, like Joseph's parents when he told them his dream,
turned short upon me, crying out, 'What does the boy mean? Pri'thee
hold thy tongue,' or something to that purpose. God has since shown
her from whom that impression came.]</p>

<p>"For a twelvemonth, I went on in a round of duties, receiving the
sacrament monthly, fasting frequently, attending constantly on public
worship, and praying often more than twice a day in private. One of my
brothers used to tell me he feared this would not hold long, and that I
should forget all when I came to Oxford. This caution did me much
service, for it set me upon praying for perseverance; and, under God, the
preparation I made in the country was a preservative against the manifold
temptations which beset me at my first coming to that seat of
learning.</p>

<p>"Being now near eighteen years old, it was judged proper for me to
go to the University. God had [sweetly] prepared my way. The friends
before applied to recommended me to the master of Pembroke College.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Another friend took up £10 upon bond, which I have since repaid, to
defray the first expense of entering; and the master,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> contrary to all expectations,
admitted the servitor immediately."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus ends Whitefield's history of his own boyhood.
His confession of youthful wickedness is more minute than
profitable. It was scarcely wise for a young evangelist of
twenty-five, who had attained an unexampled popularity,
and thereby brought upon himself the rancour of envious
observers, to print such an enumeration of juvenile sins
and follies. Indeed, the wisdom of doing this may be
justly questioned in any case. A man may and ought
to confess to God; but he is under no obligation to confess
to men like himself. As already stated, the foregoing
details would not have been reproduced in the present
work, had it not been that this was necessary to exhibit
the imprudent ingenuousness of the youthful preacher, and
to show that his own unguarded writings fairly exposed
him to some of the bitter pamphleteering with which he
was soon attacked. Augustine had written similar Confessions,
and so also had Jean Jacques Rousseau; but the
world is none the better because Augustine and Rousseau
made the world their father confessor. Whitefield's enemies
were not slow to use the advantage against him with which
he had furnished them; and, even nine years after the
publication of his pamphlet, he had to pay a penalty for
some of its well-meant, but inconsiderate expressions. "Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Whitefield's account of God's dealings with him," said Dr.
Lavington, Bishop of Exeter, "is such a boyish, ludicrous,
filthy, nasty, and shameless relation of himself, as quite
defiles paper, and is shocking to decency and modesty.
'Tis a perfect jakes of uncleanness."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The reader, with
the "account" unabridged before him, can easily form an
opinion of the truthfulness, or rather free-tongued censure,
of Whitefield's episcopal castigator. Whitefield assigned a
reason for what he did; and, though the sufficiency of that
reason may not be admitted, yet all will give Whitefield
credit for sincerity and good intentions, and no spiritually
minded man will laugh at the penitential spirit which the
confessions unquestionably evince.</p>

<p>As in the case of many others, Whitefield's boyhood was
a strange admixture of sin and penitence. At intervals, we
find the boy a liar, a petty thief, a pretended rake, a dandy,
and almost an infidel; and then we find him spending his
scantily collected pence in buying the manual of Bishop
Ken; composing sermons; delighting in Thomas à Kempis;
reading books like Drelincourt's "Christian Defence against
the Fears of Death;" promoting a reformation of manners
among the boys in the school of St. Mary de Crypt;
religiously watching over his own thoughts, words, and
actions; praying in private; worshipping in public; receiving
the sacrament once a month; and, during Lent
and at other times, frequently fasting for eighteen hours
together. The Oxford Methodists, of whom perhaps he
had never heard, were now approaching the very climax
of their ascetic practices; and the quondam tapster of the
Bell Inn, Gloucester, by a strange experience, was prepared
to join them. Bad companions had nearly ruined him; but
now his companions were to be of another sort.</p>

<p>In the midst of all his wickedness and youthful frolics,
Whitefield displayed an undauntedness which helped to
make him what he afterwards became. His educational
advantages were not great. Unlike the Wesleys, his home
was not favourable to his mental improvement. The public-house
in which he was born and bred was widely different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
from the Epworth parsonage. Practically he was fatherless
whilst the Wesley brothers had for a father a man
who, though sometimes improvident in attending convocations
and in the publishing of books, had, in learning, but
few superiors, and, as a clergyman of the Church of England,
was excelled by none. Whitefield's mother was, evidently,
an affectionate, sensible, and worthy woman; but, in most
respects, immeasurably inferior to Susannah Wesley. Besides
having had the unspeakable advantages of their Epworth
home-education, John Wesley was privileged to spend five
years and a half at the Charterhouse, London; and his
brother Charles about the same length of time in the equally
famed school of Westminster. On the other hand, Whitefield
had no education, worth mentioning, until he was
twelve years old; from twelve to fifteen he spent in the
school of St. Mary de Crypt, partly in acquiring learning
and partly in acting plays; from fifteen to seventeen, he was
chiefly employed as tapster in his mother's tavern; and then
came the turning-point of his existence. After listening to
the story of the poor servitor of Pembroke College, who, by
serving others, had paid all his college expenses, and had
saved a penny, Whitefield's mother said, "George, will <em>you</em>
go to Oxford?" "Yes," said George, "with all my heart."
And, within a week, he was again at the school of St. Mary
de Crypt; and, within a year, an undergraduate of an
Oxford college. George's decision, prompt action, and
hard-working ambition displayed pluck, not unworthy of the
man, who, in later years, braved brutal mobs with heroic
boldness, and who, when the present comforts of oceanic
travelling were things unthought about, again and again
crossed the turbulent Atlantic; and, constrained by the love
of Christ his Saviour, tramped American woods and swamps,
seeking sinners, and trying to save them.</p>

<p>One other fact is noticeable. From childhood George
Whitefield was an orator. A hundred and fifty years ago
dramatic performances appear to have been an important
part of the education of the public schools of England.
Thus it was in the Westminster School, where Charles
Wesley was "put forward to act dramas," because of his
lively cleverness; and thus it was at St. Mary de Crypt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Gloucester, where Whitefield, on account of his "good elocution
and memory," was "remarked for making speeches
before the Corporation at their annual visitation;" and where
the master of the school composed dramatical pieces in
which Whitefield and his schoolfellows might display their
histrionic genius and powers. The marvellously exciting
eloquence of Whitefield was not so much an acquirement as
a gift of nature; and this helps to explain his inordinate
delight in theatrical literature, previous to his conversion.</p>

<h2><em>WHITEFIELD AT COLLEGE.</em></h2>

<h3>1732 TO 1735.</h3>


<p>Whitefield went to Oxford towards the end of
the year 1732. Twelve years before this, Wesley
had been admitted to Christ-Church College, and in the
interval had been elected Fellow of Lincoln College, had taken
his Master of Arts degree, and had been ordained deacon and
also priest. Charles Wesley had been six years at Christ-Church,
and was now Bachelor of Arts, and a College Tutor.
Willam Morgan, one of the first of the Oxford Methodists,
died a few weeks before Whitefield entered Pembroke
College. For three years past, Clayton had been at Brasenose.
Ingham had already spent two years at Queen's. In
1726, Gambold had been admitted as servitor in Christ
Church, and in 1733 was ordained by Bishop Potter.
Hervey, born in the same year as Whitefield, had, in 1731,
become undergraduate in Lincoln College, where Wesley
was Tutor. Broughton was in Exeter College. Kinchin
was a Fellow of Corpus Christi. For twelve years, Hutchins
had been Fellow of Lincoln, where also, for some time past,
Whitelamb and Westley Hall had been studying, to the
content of Wesley.</p>

<p>These were the chief of the Oxford Methodists. Whitefield,
a boy not yet eighteen years of age, was the last to
enter the University, and the last of the illustrious ones to
join their godly brotherhood. For three years, the "Holy
Club" had been notorious among their fellows; but, up to
the present, Whitefield had never seen them.</p>

<p>Pembroke College, founded in 1624, had a Master, fourteen
Fellows, twenty-four Scholars, and several Exhibitioners,
being in all about sixty. As already stated, Whitefield was
admitted as a servitor,&mdash;a lowly, but not necessarily dishonourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
position. Half a century before, Wesley's father
had "footed it" to Oxford, with forty-five shillings in his
purse, and had been received as servitor of Exeter College,
in which, during his five years' residence, five shillings
was the only assistance he received from his family and
friends. And now Wesley's great coadjutor entered Pembroke
in the same capacity, and in about the same penniless
condition.</p>

<p>It is a fact worth noticing, that Samuel Johnson left
Pembroke College only twelve months previous to Whitefield's
admission; and that the poet Shenstone entered at
the same time Whitefield did. At that period, some of the
college tutors were so inefficient, that Johnson declared, concerning
one of them, Mr. Jorden, that "he scarcely knew a
noun from an adverb." The Rev. Dr. Adams, however,
who succeeded Jorden in 1731, was a man of another stamp;
and Johnson used to boast of the many eminent men who
had been educated at Pembroke. "Sir," he used to say,
with a smile of sportive triumph, when mentioning how
many of the English poets had been trained in Pembroke
College, "Sir, we are a nest of singing birds."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Whitefield spent four years at Oxford&mdash;from 1732 to
1736. How did he employ his time, and what were the
results? For the reasons previously assigned, the history
of this important period shall be given in his own language,
without any abridgment or alteration whatever. With perfect
artlessness, he writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Soon after my admission to Pembroke College, I found my having
been used to a public-house was now of service to me. For many of the
servitors being sick at my first coming up, by my diligent and ready
attendance I ingratiated myself into the gentlemen's favour so far, that
many, who had it in their power, chose me to be their servitor.</p>

<p>"This much lessened my expense; and, indeed, God was so gracious,
that, with the profits of my place, and some little presents made me by my
kind tutor, for almost the first three years I did not put all my relations
together to above £24 expense.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> [And it has often grieved my soul to see so
many young students spending their substance in extravagant living, and
hereby entirely unfitting themselves for the prosecution of their proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
studies.] I had not been long at the University before I found the benefit
of the foundation I had laid in the country for a holy<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> life. I was quickly
solicited to join in their excess of riot with several who lay in the same
room. God, in answer to prayers before put up, gave me grace to withstand
them; and once, in particular, it being cold, my limbs were so
benumbed by sitting alone in my study, because I would not go amongst
them, that I could scarce sleep all night. But I soon found the benefit of
not yielding; for when they perceived they could not prevail, they let me
alone as a singular, odd fellow.</p>

<p>["All this while I was not fully satisfied of the sin of playing at cards
and reading plays, till God, upon a fast-day, was pleased to convince me.
For, taking a play to read a passage out of it to a friend, God struck my
heart with such power, that I was obliged to lay it down again; and&mdash;blessed
be His name!&mdash;I have not read any such book since.</p>

<p>"Before I went to the University, I met with Mr. Law's 'Serious Call
to a Devout Life,' but had not then money to purchase it. Soon after
my coming up to the University, seeing a small edition of it in a friend's
hand, I soon procured it. God worked powerfully upon my soul, as He
has since upon many others, by that and his other excellent treatise upon
'Christian Perfection.']</p>

<p>"I now began to pray and sing psalms thrice every day, besides
morning and evening, and to fast every Friday, and to receive the sacrament
at a parish church near our college, and at the castle, where the
despised Methodists used to receive once a month.</p>

<p>"The young men so called<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> were then much talked of at Oxford. I
had heard of, and loved them before I came to the University; and so
strenuously defended them when I heard them reviled by the students,
that they began to think that I also in time should be one of them.</p>

<p>"For above a twelvemonth my soul longed to be acquainted with some
of them, and I was strongly pressed to follow their good example, when
I saw them go through a ridiculing crowd to receive the holy Eucharist
at St. Mary's. At length, God was pleased to open a door. It happened
that a poor woman in one of the workhouses had attempted to cut her
throat, but was happily prevented. Upon hearing of this, and knowing
that both the Mr. Wesleys were ready to every good work, I sent a poor
aged apple-woman of our college to inform Mr. Charles Wesley of it,
charging her not to discover who sent her. She went; but, contrary to
my orders, told my name. He having heard of my coming to the castle
and a parish church sacrament, and having met me frequently walking
by myself, followed the woman when she was gone away, and sent an
invitation to me by her, to come to breakfast with him the next morning.</p>

<p>"I thankfully embraced the opportunity; [and, blessed be God! it
was one of the most profitable visits I ever made in my life. My soul, at
that time, was athirst for some spiritual friends to lift up my hands when
they hung down, and to strengthen my feeble knees. He soon discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
it, and, like a wise winner of souls, made all his discourses tend that way.
And, when he had] put into my hand Professor Frank's treatise against
the 'Fear of Man,' [and a book entitled 'The Country Parson's Advice to
his Parishioners,' the last of which was wonderfully blessed to my soul, I
took my leave.]</p>

<p>"In a short time, he let me have another book entitled, 'The Life of
God in the Soul of Man; [and, though I had fasted, watched, and
prayed, and received the sacrament so long, yet I never knew what true
religion was, till God sent me that excellent treatise by the hands of my
never-to-be-forgotten friend].</p>

<p>"At my first reading it, I wondered what the author meant by saying,
'That some falsely placed religion in going to church, doing hurt to no
one, being constant in the duties of the closet, and now and then reaching
out their hands to give alms to their poor neighbours.' 'Alas!' thought I,
'if this be not religion, what is?' God soon showed me; for in reading
a few lines further, that 'true religion was a union of the soul with God,
and Christ formed within us,' a ray of Divine light was instantaneously
darted in upon my soul, and, from that moment, but not till then, did I
know that I must be a new creature.</p>

<p>"Upon this, [like the woman of Samaria when Christ revealed Himself
to her at the well,] I had no rest [in my soul] till I wrote letters to my
relations, telling them there was such a thing as the new birth. I
imagined they would have gladly received it. But, alas! my words seemed
to them as idle tales. They thought that I was going beside myself,
and, by their letters, confirmed me in the resolutions I had taken not to
go down into the country, but continue where I was, lest that, by any
means, the good work which God had begun in my soul might be made
of none effect.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>"From time to time Mr. Wesley permitted<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> me to come unto him, and
instructed me as I was able to bear it. By degrees, he introduced me to
the rest of his Christian brethren.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> [They built me up daily in the knowledge
and fear of God, and taught me to endure hardness like a good
soldier of Jesus Christ.]</p>

<p>"I now began, like them, to live by rule, and to pick up the very
fragments of my time, that not a moment of it might be lost. Whether I
ate or drank, or whatsoever I did, I endeavoured to do all to the glory
of God. Like them, having no weekly sacrament, although the rubric
required it, at our own college, I received every Sunday at Christ Church.
I joined with them in [keeping the stations by] fasting Wednesdays and
Fridays [and left no means unused, which I thought would lead me
nearer to Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"Regular retirement, morning and evening, at first I found some
difficulty in submitting to; but it soon grew profitable and delightful. As
I grew ripe for such exercises, I was, from time to time] engaged to visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the sick and the prisoners, and to read to poor people, till I made it a
custom, as most of us did, to spend an hour every day in doing acts of
charity.</p>

<p>"The course of my studies I soon entirely changed. Whereas, before
I was busied in studying the dry sciences, and books that went no farther
than the surface, I now resolved to read only such as entered into the
heart of religion, and which led me directly into an experimental knowledge
of Jesus Christ, and Him crucified. [The lively oracles of God
were my soul's delight. The book of the Divine laws was seldom out of
my hands: I meditated therein day and night; and, ever since that,
God has made my way signally prosperous, and given me abundant
success.</p>

<p>"God enabled me to do much good to many, as well as to receive
much from the despised Methodists, and made me instrumental in converting
one who is lately come out into the Church, and, I trust, will
prove a burning and shining light.</p>

<p>"Several short fits of illness was God pleased to visit and to try me
with, after my first acquaintance with Mr. Wesley. My new convert was
a helpmeet for me in those and in all other circumstances; and, in
company with him and several other Christian friends, did I spend many
sweet and delightful hours. Never did persons, I believe, strive more
earnestly to enter in at the strait gate. They kept their bodies under
even to an extreme. They were dead to the world, and willing to be
accounted as the dung and offscouring of all things, so that they might
win Christ. Their hearts glowed with the love of God, and they never
prospered so much in the inward man, as when they had all manner of
evil spoken against them falsely without.</p>

<p>"Many came amongst them for a while, who, in time of temptation,
fell away. The displeasure of a tutor or head of a college, the changing
of a gown from a lower to a higher degree&mdash;above all, a thirst for the
praise of men, more than that which cometh from God, and a servile
fear of contempt&mdash;caused numbers, that had set their hands to the plough,
shamefully to look back. The world, and not themselves, gave them the
title of Methodists, I suppose, from their custom of regulating their time,
and planning the business of the day every morning. Mr. John and
Charles Wesley were two of the first that thus openly dared to confess
Christ; and they, under God, were the spiritual fathers of most of them.
They had the pleasure of seeing the work of the Lord prosper in their
hands before they went to Georgia. Since their return, the small grain
of mustard-seed has sprung up apace. It has taken deep root. It is
growing into a great tree. Ere long, I trust, it will fill the land, and
numbers of souls will come from the east and from the west, from the
north and from the south, and lodge under the branches of it.</p>

<p>"But to return. While I was thus comforted on every side by daily
conversing with so many Christian friends, God was pleased to permit
Satan to sift me like wheat. A general account of which I shall, by the
Divine assistance, give in the following section.</p>

<p>"At my first setting out, in compassion to my weakness, I grew in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
favour both with God and man, and used to be much lifted up with
sensible devotion, especially at the blessed sacrament. But when religion
began to take root in my heart, and I was fully convinced my soul must
totally be renewed ere it could see God, I was visited with outward and
inward trials.]</p>

<p>"The first thing I was called to give up for God was what the world
calls my fair reputation. I had no sooner received the sacrament publicly
on a weekday at St. Mary's, but I was set up as a mark for all the polite
students that knew me to shoot at. [By this they knew that I was commenced
Methodist; for though there is a sacrament at the beginning of
every term, at which all, especially the seniors, are by statute obliged
to be present, yet so dreadfully has that once faithful city played the
harlot, that very few masters, and no undergraduates but the Methodists,
attended upon it.</p>

<p>"Mr. Charles Wesley, whom I must always mention with the greatest
deference and respect, walked with me, in order to confirm me, from the
church even to the college. I confess, to my shame, I would gladly have
excused him; and the next day, going to his room, one of our Fellows
passing by, I was ashamed to be seen to knock at his door. But, blessed be
God! this fear of man gradually wore off. As I had imitated Nicodemus in
his cowardice, so, by the Divine assistance, I followed him in his courage.
I confessed the Methodists more and more publicly every day. I walked
openly with them, and chose rather to bear contempt with those people of
God, than to enjoy the applause of almost-Christians for a season.]</p>

<p>"Soon after this, I incurred the displeasure of the master of the college,
who frequently chid, and once threatened to expel me, if I ever visited the
poor again. Being surprised by this treatment,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> I spake unadvisedly
with my lips, and said, if it displeased him, I would not. My conscience
soon pricked me for this sinful compliance. I immediately repented, and
visited the poor the first opportunity, [and told my companions, if ever I
was called to a stake for Christ's sake, I would serve my tongue as Archbishop
Cranmer served his hand, namely, make that burn first.]</p>

<p>"My<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> tutor, being a worthy man, did not oppose me [much, but thought,
I believe, that I went a little too far. He lent me books, gave me money,
visited me, and furnished me with a physician when sick. In short,
he behaved in all respects like a father; and I trust God will remember
him for good, in answer to the many prayers I have put up in his
behalf.</p>

<p>"My relations were quickly alarmed at the alteration of my behaviour,
conceived strong prejudices against me, and for some time counted my
life madness.] I daily underwent some contempt at college. Some have
thrown dirt at me; others by degrees took away their pay from me; and
two friends that were dear unto me grew shy of and forsook me, [when
they saw me resolved to deny myself, take up my cross daily, and follow
Jesus Christ. But our Lord, by His Spirit, soon convinced me that I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
know no one after the flesh; and I soon found that promise literally fulfilled,
'That no one hath left father or mother, brethren or sisters, houses
or lands, for Christ's sake and the Gospel's, but he shall receive a hundredfold
in this life, with persecution, as well as eternal life in the world to
come.'</p>

<p>"These, though little, were useful trials. They inured me to contempt,
lessened self-love, and taught me to die daily.] My inward sufferings were
of a more uncommon nature. [Satan seemed to have desired me in
particular to sift me as wheat. God permitted him for wise reasons, I
have seen already, namely, that His future blessings might not prove my
ruin.</p>

<p>"From my first awakenings to the divine life, I felt a particular hungering
and thirsting after the humility of Jesus Christ. Night and day I
prayed to be a partaker of that grace, imagining that the habit of humility
would be instantaneously infused into my soul. But as Gideon taught the
men of Succoth with thorns, so God, if I am yet in any measure blessed
with true poverty of spirit, taught it me by the exercise of strong temptations.</p>

<p>"I observed before how I used to be favoured with sensible devotion;
those] comforts were soon withdrawn, and a horrible fearfulness and dread
permitted to overwhelm my soul. [One morning in particular, rising from
my bed, I felt an unusual impression and weight upon my breast, attended
with inward darkness. I applied to my friend, Mr. Charles Wesley. He
advised me to keep upon my watch, and referred me to a chapter in
Kempis. In a short time I perceived this load gradually increase, till it
almost weighed me down, and fully convinced me that Satan had as real a
possession of, and power given over, my body, as he had once over Job's.]
All power of meditating, or even thinking, was taken from me. My
memory quite failed me. My whole soul was barren and dry, and I
could fancy myself to be like nothing so much as a man locked up in iron
armour. Whenever I kneeled down, I felt great<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> heavings in my body,
and have often prayed under the weight of them till the sweat came through
me. [At this time, Satan used to terrify me much, and threatened to punish
me if I discovered his wiles. It being my duty, as servitor, in my turn to
knock at the gentlemen's rooms by ten at night, to see who were in their
rooms, I thought the devil would appear to me every stair I went up. And
he so troubled me when I lay down to rest, that for some weeks I scarce
slept above three hours at a time.]</p>

<p>"God only knows how many nights I have lain upon my bed groaning
under the weight I felt, [and bidding Satan depart from me in the name
of Jesus.] Whole days and weeks have I spent in lying prostrate on the
ground,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> [and begging for freedom from those proud hellish thoughts that
used to crowd in upon and distract my soul. But God made Satan drive
out Satan; for these thoughts and suggestions created such a self-abhorrence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
within me, that I never ceased wrestling with God till He blessed
me with a victory over them. Self-love, self-will, pride, and envy so
buffeted me in their turns, that I was resolved either to die or conquer.
I wanted to see sin as it was, but feared, at the same time, lest the sight
of it should terrify me to death.</p>

<p>"Whilst my inward man was thus exercised, my outward man was not
unemployed. I soon found what a slave I had been to my sensual
appetite, and now resolved to get the mastery over it by the help of Jesus
Christ.] Accordingly, by degrees, I began to leave off eating fruits and
such like, and gave the money I usually spent in that way to the poor.
Afterward, I always chose the worst sort of food, though my place furnished
me with variety. I fasted twice a week. My apparel was mean. I thought
it unbecoming a penitent to have his hair powdered. I wore woollen gloves,
a patched gown, and dirty shoes;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and [though I was then convinced that
the kingdom of God did not consist in meats and drinks, yet I resolutely
persisted in these voluntary acts of self-denial, because I found them great
promoters of the spiritual life.]</p>

<p>"For many months, I went on in this<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> state, [faint, yet pursuing, and
travelling along in the dark, in hope that the star I had before once seen
would hereafter appear again. During this season I was very active;] but
finding pride creeping in at the end of almost every thought, word, and
action, and meeting with Castaniza's 'Spiritual Combat,' in which he says
'that he that is employed in mortifying his will was as well employed as
though he was converting Indians,' or words to that effect, Satan so
imposed upon my understanding, that he persuaded me to shut myself up
in my study till I could do good<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> [with a single eye], lest, in endeavouring
to save others as I did now, I should at last, by pride and self-complacence,
lose myself.</p>

<p>["Henceforward, he transformed himself into an angel of light, and
worked so artfully, that I imagined the good, and not the evil, spirit
suggested to me everything I did.</p>

<p>"His main drift was to lead me into a state of quietism (he generally
ploughed with God's heifer); and when the Holy Spirit put into my heart
good thoughts or convictions, he always drove them to extremes. For
instance, having out of pride put down in my diary what I gave away,
Satan tempted me to lay my diary quite aside. When Castaniza<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> advised
to talk but little, Satan said I must not talk at all. So that I, who used
to be the most forward in exhorting my companions, have sat whole
nights almost without speaking at all. Again, when Castaniza advised to
endeavour after a silent recollection and waiting upon God, Satan told me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
I must leave off all forms, and not use my voice in prayer at all. The
time would fail me to recount all the instances of this kind in which he
had deceived me. But when matters came to an extreme, God always
showed me my error, and by His Spirit pointed out a way for me to
escape.</p>

<p>"The devil also sadly imposed upon me in the matter of my college
exercises. Whenever I endeavoured to compose my theme, I had no
power to write a word, nor so much as to tell my Christian friends of my
inability to do it. Saturday being come, which is the day the students
give up their compositions, it was suggested to me that I must go down
into the hall, and confess I could not make a theme, and so publicly
suffer, as if it were, for my Master's sake. When the bell rung to call us, I
went to open the door to go down stairs, but feeling something give me a
violent inward check, I entered my study, and continued instant in prayer,
waiting the event. For this my tutor fined me half a crown. The next
week Satan served me in like manner again; but now having got more
strength, and perceiving no inward check, I went into the hall. My name
being called, I stood up and told my tutor I could not make a theme. I
think he fined me a second time; but, imagining that I would not
willingly neglect my exercise, he afterward called me into the common
room, and kindly enquired whether any misfortune had befallen me, or
what was the reason I could not make a theme. I burst into tears, and
assured him that it was not out of contempt of authority, but that I could
not act otherwise. Then, at length, he said he believed I could not; and,
when he left me, told a friend, as he very well might, that he took me to
be really mad. This friend, hearing from my tutor what had happened,
came to me, urging the command of Scripture, to be subject to the higher
powers. I answered, 'Yes; but I had a new revelation.' Lord, what is
man?</p>

<p>"As I daily got strength, by continued, though almost silent, prayer in
my study, my temptations grew stronger also, particularly for two or
three days before deliverance came.]</p>

<p>"Near five or six weeks I had now spent in my study, except when<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> I
was obliged to go out. During this time I was fighting with my corruptions,
and did little else besides kneeling down by my bedside, feeling, as
it were, a heavy pressure upon my body, as well as an unspeakable
oppression of mind, yet offering up my soul to God to do with me as it
pleased Him. It was now suggested to me that Jesus Christ was among the
wild beasts when He was tempted, and that I ought to follow His example;
and being willing, as I thought, to imitate Jesus Christ, after supper I went
into Christ Church walk, near our college, and continued in silent prayer
under one of the trees [for near two hours, sometimes lying flat on my
face, sometimes] kneeling upon my knees, [all the while filled with fear
and concern lest some of my brethren should be overwhelmed with
pride. The night being stormy, it gave me awful thoughts of the day of
judgment. I continued, I think,] till the great bell rung for retirement to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the college, not without finding some reluctance in the natural man against
staying so long in the cold.</p>

<p>["The next night I repeated the same exercise at the same place. But
the hour of extremity being now come, God was pleased to make an open
show of those diabolical devices by which I had been deceived.]</p>

<p>"By this time, I had left off keeping my diary, using my forms, or scarce
my voice in prayer, visiting prisoners, etc. Nothing remained for me to
leave, unless I forsook public worship, but my religious friends. Now it
was suggested that I must leave them also for Christ's sake. This was a
sore trial; but rather than not be, as I fancied, Christ's disciple, I
resolved to renounce them, though as dear to me as my own soul.
Accordingly, the next day being Wednesday, whereon we kept one of our
weekly fasts, instead of meeting with my brethren as usual, I went out into
the fields, and prayed silently by myself. Our evening meeting I neglected
also, and went not to breakfast, according to appointment, with Mr.
Charles Wesley the day following. This, with many other concurring
circumstances, made my honoured friend, Mr. Charles Wesley, suspect
something more than ordinary was the matter. He came to my room,
[soon found out my case,] apprised me of my danger if I would not take
advice, and recommended me to his brother John, Fellow of Lincoln
College, as more experienced<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> [in the spiritual life]. God gave me&mdash;[blessed
be His holy name]&mdash;a teachable temper, and I waited upon his brother,
with whom from that time I had the honour of growing intimate. He
advised me to resume all my externals, though not to depend on them in
the least. From time to time he gave me directions as my [various and]
pitiable state required; [and, at length, by his excellent advice and management
of me, under God, I was delivered from those wiles of Satan.
'Praise the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me praise His holy
name!']</p>

<p>["During this and all other seasons of temptation my soul was inwardly
supported with great courage and resolution from above. Every day
God made me willing to renew the combat, and though my soul, when
quite empty of God, was very prone to seek satisfaction in the creature,
and sometimes I fell into sensuality, yet I was generally enabled to wait
in silence for the salvation of God, or to persist in prayer till some beams
of spiritual light and comfort were vouchsafed me from on high. Thomas
à Kempis, since translated and published by Mr. John Wesley; Castaniza's
Combat; and the Greek Testament, every reading of which I
endeavoured to turn into a prayer, were of great help and furtherance to
me. On receiving the holy sacrament, especially before trials, I have
found grace in a very affecting manner, and in abundant measure, sometimes
imparted to my soul,&mdash;an irrefragable proof to me of the miserable
delusion of the author of that work called, 'The Plain Account of the
Sacrament,' which sinks that holy ordinance into a bare memorial, who,
if he obstinately refuse the instruction of the Most High, will doubtless,
without repentance, bear his punishment, whosoever he be.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"To proceed&mdash;I had now taken up my externals again;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> [and though
Satan for some weeks had been biting my heel, God was pleased to show
me that I should soon bruise his head.] A few days after, as I was walking
along, I met with a poor woman whose husband was then in [Bocardo,
or] Oxford Town-Gaol, [which I constantly visited.] Seeing her much
discomposed, I enquired the cause. She told me, not being able to bear
the crying of her children, ready to perish for hunger, and having nothing
to relieve them, she had been to drown herself, but was mercifully prevented,
and said she was coming to my room to inform me of it. I gave
her some immediate relief, and desired her to meet me at the prison with
her husband in the afternoon. She came, and there God visited them
both by His free grace. She was powerfully quickened from above;
and when I had done reading, he also came to me like the trembling
gaoler, and, grasping my hand, cried out, 'I am upon the brink of hell!'.
From this time forward, both of them grew in grace. God, by His providence,
soon delivered him from his confinement. Though notorious
offenders against God and one another before, yet now they became helpmeets
for each other in the great work of their salvation. They are both
now living, and, I trust, will be my joy and crown of rejoicing in the great
day of our Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>"Soon after this, [the holy season of] Lent came on, which our friends
kept very strictly, eating no flesh during the six weeks, except on Saturdays
and Sundays. I abstained frequently on Saturdays also, and ate nothing
on the other days, except on Sunday, but sage-tea without sugar, and
coarse bread. I constantly walked out in the cold mornings till part of
one of my hands was quite black. This, with my continued abstinence
and inward conflicts, at length so emaciated my body, that, at Passion-week,
finding I could scarce creep upstairs, I was obliged to inform my
kind tutor of my condition, who immediately sent for a physician to me.</p>

<p>"This caused no small triumph amongst the collegians, who began to
cry out, 'What is his fasting come to now?' [But I rejoiced in this
reproach, knowing that, though I had been imprudent, and lost much of
my flesh, yet, I had nevertheless increased in the spirit.]</p>

<p>["This fit of sickness continued upon me for seven weeks, and a
glorious visitation it was.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The blessed Spirit was all this time purifying
my soul. All my former gross and notorious, and even my heart sins also,
were now set home upon me, of which I wrote down some remembrance
immediately, and confessed them before God morning and evening.
Though weak, I often spent two hours in my evening retirements, and
prayed over my Greek Testament and Bishop Hall's most excellent
'Contemplations' every hour that my health would permit.] About the
end of the seven weeks,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> [and after I had been groaning under an unspeakable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
pressure both of body and mind for above a twelvemonth, God was
pleased to set me free in the following manner. One day, perceiving an
uncommon drought and a disagreeable clamminess in my mouth, and
using things to allay my thirst, but in vain, it was suggested to me that
when Jesus Christ cried out, 'I thirst,' His sufferings were near at an end.
Upon which I cast myself down on the bed, crying out, 'I thirst! I thirst!'
Soon after this, I found and felt in myself that I was delivered from the
burden that had so heavily oppressed me. The spirit of mourning was
taken from me, and I knew what it was truly to rejoice in God my Saviour,
and, for some time, could not avoid singing psalms wherever I was; but
my joy gradually became more settled, and, blessed be God, has abode and
increased in my soul, saving a few casual intermissions, ever since.</p>

<p>"Thus were the days of my mourning ended. After a long night of
desertion and temptation, the star, which I had seen at a distance before,
began to appear again, and the day star arose in my heart. Now did the
Spirit of God take possession of my soul, and, as I humbly hope, seal me
unto the day of redemption."]</p></blockquote>

<p>Here we must pause. Whitefield evidently considered
this to be the time of his conversion. The date was about
seven weeks after Easter, in the year 1735. This was
three years before the Wesley brothers professed to receive
the same blessing. In fact, young Whitefield seems to have
been the first of the Oxford Methodists who attained to the
experience expressed in Romans viii. 15, 16: "Ye have
not received the Spirit of bondage, again to fear; but ye
have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,
Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit
that we are the children of God: and if children, then heirs;
heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ." It cannot be
denied that Whitefield's first account of the way in which
he obtained this gift of God is tinged with fanaticism. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
second and revised account, published sixteen years afterwards,
is unobjectionable. Oppressed with a sense of sin,
and buffeted by Satan, the young servitor laid hold of
Christ "by a living faith," received "the spirit of adoption,"
was blessed with "a sense of the pardoning love of God,"
and filled with "joy unspeakable" and "big with glory."</p>

<p>Whitefield's history of his college life, especially the first
edition of it, brought upon him the scathing criticisms of
both friends and foes. The recital of his diabolical buffetings
is more minute than sensible, and was sure to excite the
sarcastic laughter of men like Lavington. The taciturnity
which came over him is neither to be desired nor commended.
His religious jargon, partly bracketed and partly otherwise,
is not "good to the use of edifying." The lengthy descriptions
of his fastings, prayers, and devotions have a somewhat
pharisaic tinge. But, notwithstanding all these animadversions,
this section of Whitefield's autobiography is useful and
important. Throughout, it exhibits the spirit, the principles,
and the practices of the Oxford Methodists. It shows that
college life at Oxford was profligately wicked, and that men
like the Oxford Methodists were greatly needed. It reveals
the significant and momentous fact that the work of God was
not confined to the Oxford University, for, in his way, young
Whitefield was intensely religious before he left his home at
Gloucester. The omnipresent Spirit was preparing men for
a great work in different places&mdash;not only in Oxford and
Gloucester, but, as will be seen hereafter, in various parts of
the United Kingdom, and even across the Atlantic.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When I was sixteen years of age," said Whitefield, a few months
before he died, "I began to fast twice a week for thirty-six hours together,
prayed many times a day, received the sacrament every Sabbath, fasted
myself almost to death all the forty days of Lent, during which I made it
a point of duty never to go less than three times a day to public worship,
besides seven times a day to my private prayers; yet I knew no more that
I was to be born a new creature in Christ Jesus, than if I had never been
born at all. I had a mind to be upon the stage, but then I had a qualm
of conscience. I used to ask people, 'Pray can I be a player, and yet go
to sacrament, and be a Christian?' 'O,' said they, 'such a one, who is a
player, goes to sacrament; though, according to the law of the land, no
player should receive the sacrament unless he gives proof that he repents;
that was Archbishop Tillotson's doctrine.' 'Well then,' said I, 'if that be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the case, I will be a player;' and I thought to act my part for the devil as
well as anybody. But, blessed be God, He stopped me in my career. I
must bear testimony to my old friend, Mr. Charles Wesley. He put a
book into my hands, called 'The Life of God in the Soul of Man,' whereby
God showed me that I must be born again or be damned. I know the
place; it may perhaps be superstitious, but, whenever I go to Oxford, I
cannot help running to the spot where Jesus Christ first revealed Himself
to me, and gave me the new birth. I learned that a man may go to church,
say his prayers, receive the sacrament, and yet not be a Christian. How
did my heart rise and shudder like a poor man that is afraid to look into
his ledger, lest he should find himself a bankrupt. 'Shall I burn this
book? Shall I throw it down? Or shall I search it?' I did search it;
and, holding the book in my hand, thus addressed the God of heaven and
earth: 'Lord, if I am not a Christian, for Jesus Christ's sake show me
what Christianity is, that I may not be damned at last.' I read a little
further, and discovered that they who know anything of religion know it is
a vital union with the Son of God&mdash;Christ formed in the heart. O what
a ray of Divine life did then break in upon my soul! I fell a writing to
all my brethren and to my sisters. I talked to the students as they came
into my room. I laid aside all trifling conversation. I put all trifling
books away, and was determined to study to be a saint, and then to be a
scholar. From that moment God has been carrying on His blessed work
in my soul. I am now fifty-five years of age, and shall leave you in a few
days; but I tell you, my brethren, I am more and more convinced that
this is the truth of God, and that without it you can never be saved by
Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Nothing more need be said on the subject of Whitefield's
conversion. The reader now has Whitefield's own testimonies
at three different periods of his life. The accounts might
have been clearer, more precise, and perhaps more scripturally
expressed; but the fact is patent: Whitefield was converted&mdash;regenerated&mdash;born
again&mdash;in the year 1735. Or, perhaps,
to speak more correctly, it was in 1735, that, through a
penitent, heartfelt trust in Christ, he received "the Spirit of
adoption," God sending "forth the Spirit of His Son into his
heart, crying, Abba, Father."</p>

<p>For five years, Whitefield had been a sincere and earnest
penitent. Like all the other Oxford Methodists, he sought
salvation, not by simple, heartfelt faith in Christ, but by self-denial,
ardent piety, and the practice of good works. No
wonder that he was destitute of the joy arising from a firm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and full assurance of acceptance with God. The man relying
on his own piety and beneficence must necessarily live a
joyless, anxious, and almost miserable life; because he knows
and feels that much in his past career has been absolutely
wicked; and because, however sincere his present piety, and
however commendable his good works, he knows that, at the
best, they are exceedingly imperfect, and, so far from meriting
the Divine favour, and atoning for the iniquities of other
days, actually need the forgiveness of a long-suffering God.
No man of this description can be happy. But it is far
otherwise with the penitent, who, while diligently using all the
means of grace, and to the utmost of his power endeavouring
to serve both God and man, obeys Scripture teaching by
firmly believing that the death of Christ was a full atonement
for <em>his sins, even his</em>, and by trusting solely and exclusively
in that astounding but scripturally revealed fact for acceptance
with God, both in this world and in that which is to come.
Let a man attain to such a faith as this, or rather let him be
blessed with such a blessing (for faith is a Divine gift as well
as a human act), and he cannot fail to be filled, as Whitefield
was, with "joy unspeakable and full of glory." Even his
love to God, also, becomes what it had never been before,
inasmuch as he now, in the death of Christ, sees God's love
manifested to himself as it is manifested nowhere else. Love
kindles love, and the man serves his Maker, not merely
because it is his duty, but because he cannot help it, love
making his duty his delight. With such a belief concerning
the death of Christ, and such a trust in it, his faith in God,
in Providence, in the blessed Bible as a whole, is of necessity
higher, holier, stronger, broader, firmer than it ever could be
without such a belief and trust; and the same may also
be said respecting hope, and all the other Divine gifts and
Christian virtues possessed and exercised by the genuinely
converted man.</p>

<p>It was not until the year 1735 that Whitefield attained to
such a state as this; and three more years elapsed before his
friends and religious preceptors, John and Charles Wesley,
were brought to the same self-renunciating crisis, and were
enabled by the Holy Spirit to trust simply and solely in the
blood of Christ for personal, present, and endless salvation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>From this point in their history, all the three were "new
creatures in Christ Jesus." This will be seen hereafter;
but, before proceeding further, it may be instructive and
profitable to look at them again in their transition period.
Pietists more sincere and earnest never lived; and yet none
of them were happy. They were ready to do and almost
to suffer anything and everything that would be conducive to
the Divine honour; and yet they were in doubt and darkness
respecting their being blessed with the Divine favour. The
reason of this perplexed them. To others it is obvious.
The language of St. Paul concerning the Jews may, with
perfect propriety, be applied to the Oxford Methodists: "I
bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not
according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of God's
righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness,
have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness
of God."</p>

<p>The following extracts from letters, written by Whitefield
during the twelve months immediately preceding his conversion,
will not only help to elucidate his character, but will
also confirm what has just been said respecting the principles,
and piety, and personal experience of the Oxford Methodists
at this important period of their history.</p>

<p>On the death of a young friend, Whitefield wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Oxon, July 18, 1734. I envy him his blessed condition. He, unquestionably,
is divinely blessed, whilst we are still left behind to wrestle with
unruly passions, and, by a continued looking unto Jesus and running in
our Christian race, to press forward to that high prize of which he, dear
youth, is now in full fruition."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Bristol, September 10, 1734. You tell me Mr. P. wants to know my
quality, state, condition, and circumstances. Alas! that any one should
enquire after such a wretch as I am. However, since he has been so kind,
pray tell him that, as for my quality, I was a poor, mean drawer, but, by
the distinguishing grace of God, am now intended for the ministry; as
for my estate, that I am a servitor; and as to my condition and circumstances,
that I have not of my own anywhere to lay my head, but my
friends, by God's providence, minister daily to me; and, in return for such
unmerited, unspeakable blessings, I trust the same good Being will give
me grace to dedicate myself without reserve to His service."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Oxon, September 17, 1734. We must make a great progress in
religion, to be inured, by frequent prayer and meditation, to the ecstatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
contemplation of heavenly objects, before we can arrive at true heavenly-mindedness;
and perhaps, after all our endeavours, whilst our souls are
immersed in these fleshly tabernacles, we shall make but very small
advances in so delightful and glorious an undertaking. But believe me,
sir, you cannot imagine how vastly serviceable the constant use of all the
means of religion will be in acquiring this blessed habit of mind: such as
an early rising in the morning, public and private prayer, a due temperance
in all things, and frequent meditation on the infinite love and purity
of that unparalleled pattern of all perfection, our dear Redeemer. As for
your mentioning the degeneracy of the age as an objection against our
making further advances in any religious improvement, I cannot by any
means admit of it. The Scriptures are to be the only rules of action, and
the examples of our blessed Lord and His Apostles the grand patterns
whereby we are to form the conduct of our lives. It is true, indeed, that
instances of exalted piety are rarely to be met with in the present age, and
if we were to take an estimate of religion from the lives of most of its professors,
one would think that Christianity was nothing but a dead letter.
But then it is not our religion, but ourselves that are to be blamed for this.
Would we live as the primitive Christians did, we might, no doubt, have
the same assistance vouchsafed us as they had. God's grace is never
restrained. And though we should not arrive at those heights of heavenly-mindedness,
for which some of the primitive Christians were eminent, yet
we should imitate them as far as we can, and rely on the Divine goodness
for grants of such a supply of grace as He, in His good pleasure, shall
judge most convenient for us. Be pleased to send for Mr. Law's 'Christian
Perfection' for me against my coming into the country, if printed in
a small edition."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Oxon, December 4, 1734. I am heartily glad that 'The Country
Parson'<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> has had so good an effect upon you. The 'Prayers' I hope to
send you next week. Only let me give you this caution, not to depend
upon any advice or book that is given you, but solely on the grace of God
attending it. The book which I have sent to my brother, and would recommend
to you and all my Gloucester friends, will soon convince you how
dangerous it is to be a lukewarm Christian, and that there is nothing to
be done without breaking from the world, denying ourselves daily, taking
up our cross, and following Jesus Christ. These things may seem a little
terrible at first; but, believe me, mortification itself, when once practised,
is the greatest pleasure in the world."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Oxon, February 20, 1735. I am surprised that you should have
desired that 'Collection of Prayers,'<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and be wholly unconcerned about
them ever after. Indeed, they will be of no service to you, unless you grant
me this one postulatum: 'that we must renounce ourselves.' What the
meaning of this phrase may be, the preface to the Prayers will best inform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
you. I did not doubt of its meeting with but a cold reception, it being at
first view so very contrary to flesh and blood. For, perhaps, you may
think that this renouncing of ourselves must necessarily lead us (as it
certainly does) to acts of self-denial and mortification; and that we probably
may be saved without them. And lest you should after all imagine
that true religion consists in anything besides an entire renewal of our nature
into the image of God, I have sent you a book entitled 'The Life of God
in the Soul of Man,' which will inform you what true religion is, and by
what means you may attain it; as, likewise, how wretchedly most people
err in their sentiments about it, who suppose it to be nothing else but a
mere model of outward performances, without ever considering that all
our corrupt passions must be subdued, and a complex habit of virtues,
such as meekness, lowliness, faith, hope, and the love of God and of man,
be implanted in their room, before we can have the least title to enter into
the kingdom of God; our Divine Master having expressly told us that
'unless we renounce ourselves, and take up our cross daily, we cannot be
His disciples.' I shall be glad to hear whether you keep up morning
prayers, and how often you receive the Holy Communion, there being
nothing which so much be-dwarfs us in religion as starving our souls by
keeping away from the heavenly banquet."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Oxon, March 6, 1735. I find, by what I can gather from your own
and my brother's expressions, that my late letters have met with but a cold
reception, and that you seem desirous of hearing no more of so seemingly
ungrateful a subject as submitting our wills to the will of God, which is
all that is implied in the phrase of <em>renouncing ourselves</em>. Alas, sir! what
is there that appears so monstrously terrible in a doctrine that is the
constant subject of our prayers, whenever we put up the petition, 'Thy
will be done in earth, as it is in heaven;' the import of which seems to
be this: 1. That we do everything that God wills, and nothing but what
He wills; 2. That we do everything He wills, <em>only</em> in the <em>manner</em> He
wills; 3. That we do those things He wills, only <em>because</em> He wills. This is
all I have been endeavouring to inculcate in my late letters. Dear sir, be
not dismayed. The difficulty lies only in our first setting out. Be but
vigorous at the first onset, and never fear a conquest. The renewal of
our nature is a work of great importance. It is not to be done in a day;
we have not only a new house to build up, but an old one to pull down.
The means which are necessary to be used in order to attain this end, our
cursed adversary the devil would represent to us in the most hideous
forms imaginable; but, believe me, sir, there is really more pleasure in
these formidable duties of self-denial and mortification, than in the highest
indulgences of the greatest epicure upon earth."</p></blockquote>

<p>These are fair specimens of Whitefield's letters at this
period of his history. He and the other Oxford Methodists
were profoundly sincere and earnest; but they were
legalists, trying to save themselves, instead of seeking to be
saved by Christ. Their aim was to subdue their "corrupt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
passions," and to produce within themselves the virtues of
"meekness, lowliness, faith, hope, and the love of God and
man." The means used to accomplish this aim were
public and private worship, "acts of self-denial and mortification,"
and the practice of good works. There is not a
word in Whitefield's letters respecting justification by faith
in the atoning sacrifice of the Divine Redeemer; and not a
word respecting the great fact that it is the sole work of the
Holy Spirit to subdue and destroy the "corrupt passions"
of the sinner, and to plant within him "the mind which was
in Christ Jesus." The men were morose ascetics rather
than happy Christians.</p>

<p>Henceforward, the tone of Whitefield's letters is different.
The <em>new birth</em> becomes a constant topic. The man, hitherto
so gloomy and taciturn, is jubilant. His doleful and long-continued
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">miserere</i> is exchanged for songs of praise and
thanksgiving. Hence the following, written immediately
after his conversion:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Bristol, June 12, 1735. Were not your sighs on Sunday last some
infant strugglings after the <em>new birth</em>? Surely they were; and I trust ere
long the Holy Ghost will replenish your heart with comfort and peace.
Methinks I would willingly undergo the pangs, so you might enjoy the
pleasures, of the new birth; but this must not be. All we can do is to
sympathise with and pray for each other."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Bristol, September 5, 1735. I hope to feast with you at Crypt<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> next
Sunday. Amazing, that ever sinners should sit with their Saviour! To what
dignity has Christ exalted human nature! If Mr. Pauncefort's petitions
for me ran after this manner, I should be thankful: 'That God would
finish the good which He has begun in me; that I may never seek nor be
fond of worldly preferment, but employ those talents it shall please God to
entrust me with, to His glory and the Church's good; and likewise that
the endeavours of my friends to revive true religion in the world may
meet with proper success."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, as early as June 12, 1735, Whitefield began to
write concerning "the pangs and the pleasures of the new
birth." How was it that he was not the means of leading
the Wesley brothers into the enjoyment of the same Divine
blessing? A sufficient answer to this is found in the fact
that Whitefield was now absent from Oxford, that four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
months afterwards Wesley and his brother set sail for
America, and that a long space of time elapsed before the
three friends were again united.</p>

<p>Whitefield needed rest. He had kept nine terms at Oxford,
and had not availed himself of a single vacation. Perhaps
for want of money, he had not left Oxford since the time he
entered it. His health, however, was now so seriously
affected, that recreation became imperative. Accordingly,
about the end of the month of May, he, for the first time,
left the University, and returned to his friends at Gloucester.
One of his earliest letters, written during his rustication, was
addressed to his friend Wesley, and is too full of interesting
gossip to be omitted. It will also fitly close the present
chapter of Whitefield's history.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Gloucester</span>, <em>June 11, 1735</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,&mdash;I should have taken the freedom of writing to you ere
now, had I imagined you were returned to Oxford, or had my affairs been
in any settled way; but really, sir, I have been so tossed up and down by
variety of company and temptations, that I scarcely have had time to do
anything.</p>

<p>"I suppose my dear friends have acquainted you with the occasion of
my leaving Oxford in so abrupt a manner; and Mr. Hutchin's letter has
sufficiently informed you how I was received at Gloucester.</p>

<p>"I have been a week at Bristol, and if any poor soul deserved your
pious prayers, surely mine did; for it is impossible to tell you the dangers
to which I was there exposed. But when we are weak, then are we
strong. The Lord was my support, and I escaped the hands of the enemy.
I had no great opportunities offered me at Bristol of promoting God's
glory, any further than by shewing a good example. For, alas! all my
relations seem to me in a sad tepid state; but I doubt not God will, one
day or another, open their hearts to receive the word of truth.</p>

<p>"My poor mother seems very desirous of withdrawing from the world,
and, I trust, will soon have the means put in her way to do it. My
brother, the innkeeper, has had variety of misfortunes, but, I fear, they
have not met with their intended effect. However, I hope, if I can get
him to use prayer, he will soon grow better. The captain of the ship<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
seems to be in too great a hurry to attend to religion; but he has a desire
for reading Mr. Law, which I hope will be sanctified to him.</p>

<p>"But though my relations are in this condition, I find my other
friends are not. They all vastly solicit me to pay them visits, so that, in
a short time, I trust we shall have a Religious Society. I have gotten
three clergymen at Gloucester; all I hope capable of being worked upon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
I was also sent for by the gentleman's brother where I lodge, who is
minister of Stonehouse,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> in a very pressing manner; and I trust our
meeting will be sanctified. My dear friend, who used to correspond with
me at Oxford,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> seems now to perceive some pangs of the new birth. His
greatest struggle is to leave the world. I believe he will soon get over it.
We have the whole house to ourselves. I find he has done what he could,
and seems desirous of doing more. He earnestly desires your prayers.
Last night, one Mr. Escott, a clergyman, came to see me, and we spent
the evening in religious conversation, and hope ere long to have set nights
for our meetings. Be pleased to advise me what I had best recommend
for our reading. I was thinking to take Burkitt on the New Testament.</p>

<p>"The Scriptures are now my sole study; but I am in great want of
your advice, sir, how to prosecute them, intending to read them as practicably
as possible. What do you think of Patrick on the Proverbs? I trust
God has opened a door for me, to be an instrument of propagating the
Gospel at Swansea, in Wales. The particulars you shall hear hereafter.
I want sadly some more religious books, and a set of your 'Prayers.'
Be so good, sir, as to let me have them, with a letter, next coach.</p>

<p>"I have not time to write to my dear brethren as I would; but if Mr.
Broughton, Mr. Salmon, etc., would send me a line, they cannot imagine
what service they might do. If one of them would enlarge a little on the
vanity of worldly pleasures, who knows how God may work by them? I
have a great deal more to say, but must refer it to another opportunity.
Give me leave, sir, only to send my due respects to all my brethren, and,
with my earnest petition for their importunate prayers, to subscribe myself,</p>

<h2><em>WHITEFIELD ORDAINED.</em></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">May 1735 to June 1736.</span></h3>


<p>Whitefield left Pembroke College, Oxford, at the
end of May, 1735, and returned to it in the month
of March, 1736. The history of this long interval shall be
given in his own words, from the Autobiography first published
in 1740, and revised and re-issued in 1756. He
writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As fast as I got strength after my sickness, my tutor, physician, and
some others were still urging me to go into the country, hoping thereby to
divert me, as they thought, from a too intense application to religion.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> [I
had for some time been aware of their design, and wrote letters beseeching
my mother, if she valued my soul, not to lay her commands on me to
come down. She was pleased to leave me to my choice; but,] finding at
last it was necessary for my health, and many other providential circumstances
pointing out my way, after earnest prayer for support, by the
advice of my friends, I left my sweet retirement at Oxford, and went to
Gloucester, the place of my nativity.</p>

<p>["Having now obtained mercy from God, and received the Spirit of
adoption in my heart, my friends were surprised to see me look and behave
so cheerfully, after the many reports they had heard concerning me.
However, I soon found myself to be as a sheep sent forth amongst wolves
in sheep's clothing; for they immediately endeavoured to dissuade me,
as they had lately done a friend that began with me, from a constant use
of the means of grace, especially from weekly abstinence, and receiving
the blessed sacrament. But God enabled me to resist them steadfast in
the faith; and, by keeping close to Him in His holy ordinances, I was
made to triumph over all.</p>

<p>"Being unaccustomed for some time to live without spiritual companions,
and finding none that would join heartily with me,&mdash;no, not
one,&mdash;I watched unto prayer all the day long, beseeching God to raise me
some religious associates in His own way and time.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I will endeavour either to find or make a friend,' had been my resolution
now for some time; and therefore,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> after importunate prayer one
day, I resolved to go to the house of one Mrs. W&mdash;&mdash;, to whom I had
formerly read Plays, Spectators, Pope's Homer, and such-like [trifling]
books&mdash;hoping the alteration she would now find in my sentiments might,
under God, influence her soul. [God was pleased to bless the visit with
the desired effect.] She received the word gladly. [She wanted to be
taught the way of God more perfectly,] and soon became a fool for Christ's
sake. Not long after, God made me instrumental to awaken several<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
young persons, who soon formed themselves into a little Society, and had
quickly the honour of being despised at Gloucester, as we had been before
them at Oxford. Thus, <em>all</em> that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer
persecution.</p>

<p>"My mind being now more open and enlarged, I began to read the
Holy Scriptures upon my knees, laying aside all other books, and praying
over, if possible, every line and word. This proved meat indeed, and
drink indeed, to my soul. I daily received fresh life, light, and power
from above. [I got more true knowledge from reading the book of God
in one month, than I could <em>ever</em> have acquired from <em>all</em> the writings of
men. In one word,] I found it profitable for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness, every way sufficient to make the man of God
perfect, thoroughly furnished unto every good word and work.</p>

<p>"During my absence from Oxford I spent three weeks at Bristol,
whither I went to see some relations, but could not do them much good,
because of the prejudices they had conceived against me. However, I
daily walked with God, and, going to visit<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> an aunt then in an almshouse
there, God brought in my way a young woman who was hungering and
thirsting after righteousness. She received the word into an honest and
good heart, and since has proved a true follower of Jesus Christ. [So
gracious was the Lord, even in these my very early days, not to leave
Himself without witness, in that He <em>thus</em> vouchsafed to bless my poor
endeavours in <em>every</em> place whereto His providence now sent me.]</p>

<p>"According to His abundant mercy, He also raised me up some temporal
supplies. [For some considerable time, I had followed the example
of Professor Frank, and, whenever I wanted any worldly assistance, pleaded
the Scripture promises for the things of this life, as well as that which is
to come, in the name of Jesus Christ. This is still my practice, and I
never yet failed of success. When I came from Oxford, on account of
my sickness and other extraordinary and unavoidable expenses, I owed, I
think, about £12 or £13; and when I went to Bristol, I was so poor that
I was obliged to borrow money of my kind hostess, Mrs. H&mdash;&mdash;, with
whom I lodged at Gloucester,&mdash;and whose husband and family I pray God
eternally to bless,&mdash;to bear my charges on the road. This, I bless God,
did not dishearten me; but I continued pleading the promises in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
name of Christ; and, soon after my coming to Bristol, I received an
answer. For, a brother of mine coming from sea, God inclined him to
give me four guineas and some other necessaries. And when I returned
to Gloucester, as I did after I had continued a short time at Bristol,] those
I expected should assist me did not; but persons I never spoke to, and
who, I thought, were my enemies, were raised up to supply my wants, and<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
fulfil that promise which I always pleaded, 'Seek first the kingdom of
God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto
you.'</p>

<p>["Oh, what sweet communion had I daily vouchsafed with God in prayer
after my coming again to Gloucester! How often have I been carried
out beyond myself when sweetly meditating in the fields! How assuredly
have I felt that Christ dwelt in me, and I in Him! and how did I daily
walk in the comforts of the Holy Ghost, and was edified and refreshed
in the multitude of peace! Not that I was always upon the mount;
sometimes a cloud would overshadow me; but the Sun of righteousness
quickly arose and dispelled it, and I knew it was Jesus Christ that revealed
Himself to my soul.</p>

<p>"I always observed, as my inward strength increased, so my outward
sphere of action increased proportionably.] In a short time, therefore, I
began to read to some poor people twice or thrice a week. [I likewise
visited two other little Societies besides my own; and almost every day,
both then and since, have found the benefit of being tempted myself,
because that alone taught me how to give proper advice to those that came
to me when tempted.</p>

<p>"Occasionally, as business and opportunity permitted, I generally
visited one or two sick persons every day; and though silver and gold I
had little of my own, yet, in imitation of my Lord's disciples, who entreated
in the behalf of the fainting multitude, I used to pray unto Him, and He,
from time to time, inclined several that were rich in this world to give
me money, so that I generally had a little stock for the poor always in
my hand.] One of the poor whom I visited in this manner was called
effectually by God as at the eleventh hour. She was a woman above
threescore years old, and, I really believe, died in the true faith of Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>["About this time God was pleased to enlighten my soul, and bring me
into the knowledge of His free grace, and the necessity of being justified
in His sight by faith <em>only</em>.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> This was more extraordinary, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
my friends at Oxford had rather inclined to the mystic divinity; and one
of them, a dear servant of the Lord, lately confessed he did not like me
so well at Oxford as the rest of his brethren, because I held justification
by faith <em>only</em>. And yet, he observed, I had most success. But, blessed
be God! most of us have now been taught this doctrine of Christ, and, I
hope, shall be willing to die in the defence of it. It is the good old
doctrine of the Church of England. It is what the holy martyrs in Queen
Mary's time sealed with their blood, and which I pray God, if need be,
that I and my brethren may seal with ours.</p>

<p>"Burkitt's and Henry's Expositions were of admirable use to lead me
into this and all other gospel truths. For many months have I been
almost always upon my knees, to study and pray over these books. The
Holy Spirit, from time to time, has led me into a knowledge of Divine
things, and I have been directed, by watching and reading the Scripture
in this manner, even in the minutest of circumstances, as plainly as the
Jews were, when consulting the Urim and Thummim at the high priest's
breast.</p>

<p>"Allein's 'Alarm,' Baxter's 'Call to the Unconverted,' and Janeway's
'Life,' which I read at leisure hours, much benefited me. I bless God,
the partition wall of bigotry and sect-religion was soon broken down in
my heart; for, as soon as the love of God was shed abroad in my soul,
I loved all, of whatever denomination, that loved the Lord Jesus in sincerity
of heart.</p>

<p>"During my stay here,] God enabled me to give a public testimony of
my repentance as to seeing and acting plays. For, hearing the strollers
were coming to town, and knowing what an egregious offender I had
been,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> [I wrestled with God in prayer to put me in a way to manifest my
abhorrence of my former sin and folly. In answer to this, I was stirred
up to extract]<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Mr. Law's excellent treatise, entitled 'The Absolute Unlawfulness
of the Stage Entertainments.' [God gave me favour in the
printer's sight; and, at my request, he put a little of it in the <cite>News</cite>]<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
for six weeks successively, and God was pleased to give it His blessing.</p>

<p>["Having been absent for about six months from the University, I
thought it time to think of returning thither; but, before I came to a
resolution, was convinced of the contrary.</p>

<p>"At my first coming to Gloucester, being used to visit the prisoners at
Oxford, I prayed most earnestly that God would open a door for me to
visit the prisoners here also. Quickly after, I dreamed that one of the
prisoners came to be instructed by me; and it was impressed much upon
my heart. In the morning I went to the door of the county gaol. I
knocked, but nobody came to open it. I thought the hour was not yet
come. I waited still upon God in prayer, and in some months after came
a letter from a friend at Oxford, desiring me to go to one Pebworth, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
was broken out of Oxford gaol, and was retaken at Gloucester.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> As soon
as I read this letter, it appeared to me that my prayer was now answered.
Immediately I went to the prison, assuredly gathering that the Lord called
me thither. I met with the person, and, finding him and some others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
willing to hear the word of God, and having gained leave of the keeper and
two ordinaries, I constantly read to and prayed with them every day I
was in town. I also begged money for them, whereby I was enabled to
release some of them, and cause provisions to be distributed weekly
amongst them, as also to put such books into their hands as I judged
most proper. I cannot say any one of the prisoners was effectually
wrought upon; however, much evil was prevented, many were convinced,
and my own soul was much edified and strengthened in the love of God
and man.</p>


<p>"Thus employed, I continued in my own city three months longer&mdash;despised
indeed by man, but highly blessed by the grace of God. My
understanding was enlightened, my will broken, and my affections more
and more enlivened with a zeal for Christ. Many such, I believe, were
added to our little Society as shall be saved. Fresh supplies came from
unexpected hands to defray my expenses at the University; and, at the
end of nine months, I returned thither, to the natural joy and comfort of
my friends, till I was called into holy orders&mdash;the particular circumstances
of which I shall relate in the following section.</p>

<p>"From the time I first entered the University, especially from the time
I knew what was true and undefiled Christianity, I entertained high
thoughts of the importance of the ministerial office, and was not solicitous
what place should be prepared for me, but how I should be prepared for
a place.]<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> That saying of the apostle, 'Not a novice, lest being puffed
up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the devil;' and that first
question of our excellent ordination office, 'Do you trust that you are
<em>inwardly</em> moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon you this office and
administration?' used even to make me tremble whenever I thought of
entering into the ministry. [The shyness that Moses and some other
prophets expressed, when God sent them out in a public capacity, I
thought, was sufficient to teach me not to run till I was called. He who
knoweth the hearts of men is witness that I never prayed more earnestly
against anything than I did against entering into the service of the Church
<em>so soon</em>. Oftentimes I have been in an agony of prayer, when under
convictions of my insufficiency for so great a work.] With strong crying
and tears, I have often said, 'Lord, I am a youth of uncircumcised lips!
Lord, send me not into Thy vineyard yet!' [And sometimes I had reason
to think God was angry with me for resisting His will. However, I was
resolved to pray <em>thus</em>, as long as I could. If God did not grant my
request by keeping me out of it, I knew His grace would be sufficient
to support and strengthen me whenever He sent me into the ministry.]</p>

<p>"To my prayers I added my endeavours, and wrote letters to my friends
at Oxford, beseeching them to pray to God to disappoint the designs of
my country friends, who were for my taking orders as soon as possible.
Their answer was, 'Pray we the Lord of the harvest to send thee and
many more labourers into His harvest.' [Another old and worthy minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of Christ,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> when I wrote to him about the meaning of the word 'novice,'
answered, it meant a novice in grace, not in years; and he was pleased
to add, if St. Paul were then at Gloucester, he believed St. Paul would
ordain me.] All this did not satisfy me. I still continued instant in
prayer against going into holy orders, and was not thoroughly convinced
it was the Divine will, till God, by His providence, brought me acquainted
with the present Bishop of Gloucester.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>["Before I conversed with his lordship, God was pleased to give me
previous notice of it. Long ere I had the least prospect of being called
before the bishop, I dreamed, one night, I was talking with him in his
palace, and that he gave me some gold, which seemed to sound again in
my hand. Afterwards, this dream would often come into my mind; and
whenever I saw the bishop at church, a strong persuasion would arise in
my mind that I should very shortly go to him. I always checked it, and
prayed to God to preserve me from ever desiring that honour which
cometh of man. One afternoon it happened that the bishop took a
solitary walk, as I was told afterwards, to Lady Selwyn's, near Gloucester,
who, not long before, had made me a present of a piece of gold. She, I
found, recommended me to the bishop]; and, a few days after,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> as I was
coming from the cathedral prayers [thinking of no such thing], one of the
vergers called after me, and said the bishop desired to speak with me.
I [forgetful at that time of my dream] immediately turned back,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> considering
within myself what I had done to deserve his lordship's displeasure.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
When I came to the top of the palace stairs, the bishop took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
me by the hand, told me he was glad to see me, and bid me wait a little
till he had put off his habit, and he would return to me again. [This
gave me an opportunity of praying to God for His assistance, and adoring
Him for His providence over me.]</p>

<p>"At his coming [again] into the room, the bishop told me he had heard
of my character, liked my behaviour at church, and, enquiring my age,
said, 'Notwithstanding I have declared I would not ordain any one under
three and twenty, yet I shall think it my duty to ordain you whenever you
come for holy orders.' [He then made me a present of five guineas to
buy me a book, which, sounding again in my hand, put me in mind
of my dream; whereupon my heart was filled with a sense of God's
love.]</p>

<p>"Before I came home, this news<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> had reached my friends; who, being
fond of my having such a great man's favour, were very solicitous to know
the event of my visit. Many things I hid from them; but, when they
pressed me hard, I was obliged to tell them how the bishop, of his own
accord, had offered to give me holy orders whenever I would; on which
they, knowing how I had depended on the declaration his lordship had
made some time ago, that he would ordain none under three and twenty,
said,&mdash;and I began to think myself,&mdash;'That if I held out any longer I
should fight against God.' At length, I came to a resolution, by God's
leave, to offer myself for holy orders the next Ember days.</p>

<p>"The only thing now in dispute was into what part of my Lord's vineyard
I should be sent to labour first. God had given me much success in
Gloucester; and, my friends being desirous of having me near them, I had
thoughts of settling among them. But, when I came to Oxford, my friends
there urged several reasons for my continuing at the University. 'The Mr.
Wesleys had not long gone abroad, and now no one was left to take care
of the prison affairs,' etc. They further urged, 'That God had blessed
my endeavours <em>there</em>, as well as at Gloucester; that the University was
the fountain-head; that every gownsman's name was legion; and that
if I should be made instrumental of converting one of <em>them</em>, it would be
as much as converting a whole parish.' At the same time, unknown to
me, some of them sent to that great and good man, the late Sir John
Philips, who was a great encourager of the Oxford Methodists;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and,
though he had never seen, but only heard of me, yet he sent word he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
would allow me £30 a year, if I would continue at the University. Upon
this, finding the care of the prisoners would be no more than, under God,
I could undertake with pleasure, and knowing the University was the best
place to prosecute my studies, I resolved, God willing, to wait at Oxford
a blessing on the firstfruits of my ministerial labours.</p>

<p>"In the meanwhile, having before made some observations upon the
thirty-nine Articles, and proved them by Scripture,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> I strictly examined
myself by the qualifications required for a minister in St. Paul's Epistle
to Timothy, and also by every question that I knew was to be publicly
put to me at the time of my ordination. This latter I drew out in writing
at large, and sealed my approbation of it every Sunday at the blessed
sacrament. At length, Trinity Sunday being near at hand, and having
my testimonials from the college, I went, a fortnight beforehand, to
Gloucester, intending to compose some sermons, and to give myself more
particularly to prayer.</p>

<p>["But God's thoughts are not as our thoughts. When I came to
Gloucester, notwithstanding I strove and prayed for several days, and
had matter enough in my heart, yet I was so restrained that I could not
compose anything at all. I mentioned my case to one clergyman. He
said, 'I was an enthusiast.' I wrote to another who was experienced in
the divine life. He gave me some reasons why God might deal with me
in that manner, and withal promised me his prayers. I joined with him
in importunate supplication to know whether this restraint was from God
or not. At last, in reading Mr. Henry upon the Acts of the Apostles,
this passage was much pressed upon my heart, 'We assayed to go into
Bithynia, but the Spirit suffered us not.' Looking a little farther, I found
a quotation out of Ezekiel, wherein God said to that young prophet, just
after He had given him a divine and public commission, 'Thou shalt be
dumb; but when I speak unto thee, then thou shalt speak.' This made
me quite easy. The remainder of the fortnight I spent in reading the
several missions of the prophets and apostles, and wrestled with God to
give me grace to follow their good examples.]</p>

<p>"About three days before the time appointed for ordination, the bishop
came to town. The next evening, I sent his lordship an abstract of my
private examination upon these two questions: 'Do you trust that you
are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon you this office and
administration?' And, 'Are you called according to the will of our
Lord Jesus Christ, and the laws of this realm?' The next morning, I
waited on the bishop. He received me with much love, telling me 'he
was glad I was come; that he was satisfied with the preparation I had
made, and with the allowance given me by Sir John Philips. I had
myself,' said he, 'made provision for you of two little parishes; but since
you choose to be at Oxford, I am very well pleased. [I doubt not but you
will do much good.'] Upon this, I took my leave, abashed with God's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
goodness to such a wretch, but withal exceedingly rejoiced that, in every
circumstance, He made my way into the ministry so very plain before my
face.</p>

<p>"This, I think, was on Friday. The day following I continued in
abstinence and prayer. In the evening, I retired to a hill near the town,
and prayed fervently for about two hours, in behalf of myself and those
that were to be ordained with me.</p>

<p>"On Sunday morning, I rose early, and prayed over St. Paul's Epistle
to Timothy, and more particularly over that precept, 'Let no one despise
thy youth.' [When I went up to the altar, I could think of nothing but
Samuel's standing a little child before the Lord with a linen ephod.]
When the bishop laid his hands upon my head,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> [my heart was melted
down, and] I offered up my whole spirit, soul, and body to the service of
God's sanctuary. I read the Gospel, at the bishop's command, with
power, and afterward sealed the good confession I had made before many
witnesses, by partaking of the holy sacrament of our Lord's most blessed
body and blood.</p>

<p>["Being restrained from writing, as was before observed, I could not
preach in the afternoon, though much solicited thereto; but I read prayers
to the poor prisoners, being willing to let the first act of my ministerial
office be an act of charity.</p>

<p>"The next morning, waiting upon God in prayer to know what He
would have me to do, these words, 'Speak out, Paul,' came with great
power to my soul. Immediately my heart was enlarged. God spake to
me by His Spirit, and I was no longer dumb. I finished a sermon I had
in hand some time before. I began another; and preached the Sunday
following to a very crowded audience, with as much freedom as though I
had been a preacher for some years.</p>

<p>"Oh, the unspeakable benefit of reading to the poor, and exercising
our talents while students at the University! Such previous acts are
very proper to prepare us for the work of our Lord, and make us not
unapt to teach in a more public manner. It is remarkable that our Lord
sent out His Apostles on short missions before they were so solemnly
authorized at the day of Pentecost. Would the Heads and Tutors of our
Universities follow His example, and, instead of discouraging their pupils
from doing anything of this nature, send them to visit the sick and
prisoners, and to pray with, and read practical books of religion to the
poor, they would find such exercises of more service to them, and to the
Church of God, than all their private and public lectures put together.</p>

<p>"Thus God dealt with my soul. At the same time, by His gracious
providence, He supplied me with all things needful for my body also.
For He inclined the bishop's heart to give me five guineas more; and,
by this time, a quarter's allowance was due to me from Sir John Philips;
both which sums put together fully served to defray the expenses of my
ordination, and of taking up my bachelor's degree, which was conferred on
me at Oxford the week after my being ordained, when I was about one
and twenty years of age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"These changes from a servitor to a Bachelor of Arts&mdash;from a common
drawer to a clergyman&mdash;were no doubt temptations to think more highly
of myself than I ought to think; and some were therefore jealous over
me, as I trust they always will be, with a godly jealousy. God, who is
rich in mercy, thereby forewarned me of my danger, stirred up my heart
to pray against spiritual pride, and kept me, as I hope He will to the end,
in some measure always humbled before Him.</p>

<p>"Thus did God, by a variety of unseen acts of providence and grace, train
me up for, and at length introduce me into, the service of His Church."]</p></blockquote>

<p>Here ends all that is <em>biographical</em> in Whitefield's "Short
Account of God's Dealings with him from his Infancy to
the time of his entering into Holy Orders." The pamphlet
concludes with an address to the reader, and with Addison's
hymn, beginning&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"When all Thy mercies, O my God."
</p>

<p>What ought to be said respecting this remarkable publication?
At the time, it was pre-eminently remarkable, much
more so than it would have been a hundred years afterwards.
The world was not accustomed to such pious outpourings.
It might have passed muster among Cromwell's Roundheads;
and in the present age it would probably have died a silent
death, no one either brandishing the scalping knife of the
censorious critic, or dropping the tear of a loving lamenter
upon its tomb. A hundred and thirty years ago the state
of things was widely different to the circumstances now
existing. Then religion was ridiculed rather than revered.
Rare were the pious biographies committed to the press.
It was almost&mdash;perhaps an absolutely&mdash;unheard-of thing
for a man to publish his own religious experience. At
all events, never before had a young clergyman of the
Church of England, only twenty-five years of age, perpetrated
an act like this. Bishops, priests, deacons, and
literati of all descriptions were unpleasantly surprised; many
were almost savagely indignant. Who was the piously pert
neophyte writing in a strain like this? How should his
publication be treated? Would it be best to be silently contemptuous?
That was impossible; for the writer, though
so young, had become one of the most notorious men in
England. Would it be wise to review it out of existence
by philosophical and sober disquisitions on its mysterious
expressions, its general style, and its startling statements?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Nay, this would be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">infra dignitatem</i>. The only way remaining
was to treat the book with disdainful ridicule,
and its youthful author with the sarcastic severity merited
by a vain, conceited, bouncing enthusiast, whose religion
had made him mad.</p>

<p>This was the kind of treatment young Whitefield had
to meet. Did he deserve it? Answers to this question
will be different, according to the standpoints occupied.
The man of the world will say "Yes." The response of
the educated, fastidious religionist will, perhaps, be to the
same effect&mdash;quite as firm, though not so loud. Men
who experience and practise the same religion Whitefield
did, will yield a general approval, but object to particular
statements and expressions.</p>

<p>This, substantially, was done by Whitefield himself, when,
sixteen years afterwards, he published his revised edition.
As already stated, in the preface of 1756, he distinctly
declares that many mistakes have been rectified, and many
passages, justly exceptionable, erased. In the foot notes,
the reader has seen the rectifications; and, in the passages
which are bracketed, he has seen the erasures. There can
be no question that the sentences and paragraphs omitted
were faults. Whitefield was simple-minded, humble, and
ingenuous; but, in order to magnify the grace of God, he
sometimes furnished the censorious critic with an opportunity
to pronounce him vain, conceited, self-glorious, proud of
prayer and piety. Such a judgment, however, would be
unjust. Whitefield's autobiography has many faults; but
they are mental rather than moral,&mdash;the faults of defective
training, inexperience, youthfulness, and impulsive ardour,&mdash;rather
than of self-conceit and pride. No man knew Whitefield
better than Wesley did, and no man had a wider
acquaintance with human character; and yet Wesley, in advanced
life, perfectly exonerated Whitefield from charges like
the fore-mentioned, and declared, in reference to the very
statements contained in the book now in question, that,
"For their artless and unaffected simplicity, they may vie
with any writings of the kind."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<h2><em>COMMENCEMENT OF MINISTRY.</em></h2>

<h3>1736.</h3>


<p>Sunday, June 20, 1736, was a grand day to Whitefield.
In the imposing old cathedral, founded by
Osric, "sub-regulus" of Ethelred, King of Mercia&mdash;an edifice
in which Robert of Gloucester, author of the rhyming
"Chronicle of England," had been a monk; and John
Hooper, the immortal martyr, had been Gloucester's first
Protestant prelate&mdash;stood a youth, who, five years before,
had been a common tapster in an adjoining public-house.
For three years and a half, by acting as a servitor, he had
almost entirely maintained himself in Pembroke College,
Oxford. His progress in learning had been such that
he was soon to be a Bachelor of Arts. By the unsolicited
and exceptional favour of Bishop Benson, at the early age
of a little more than twenty-one, he now presented himself
for admission into holy orders. Notwithstanding his wickedness
as a child, and his fondness for "playing roguish tricks,"
he had always wished to be a clergyman, and had, many a
time, amused himself and the companions of his boyhood by
imitating ministers reading prayers. In his eighteenth year,
before he went to Oxford, he had told his mother that he
meant, ere long, to be a preacher; and had been rebuked
for his arrogance by the good woman asking what he meant,
and telling him to hold his tongue. But now the fond
mother was, probably, present, in the fine old church, to
witness the consummation of her George's wish&mdash;her heart
filled to overflowing with honest pride and pious gratitude.
And there, in all likelihood, was Gabriel Harris, one of Whitefield's
earliest friends; and Robert Raikes, the manager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and printer of the <cite>Gloucester Journal</cite>, one of Whitefield's
warm admirers, and the <em>reputed</em> founder of Sunday schools;
and also not a few of Whitefield's young companions, with
whom, in days not long since past, he had acted theatricals,
for the amusement of the mayor and aldermen of the city,
and of the head master of St. Mary de Crypt's pleasure-loving
school. The hour was a solemn one for the young
candidate, but it was also full of joy. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Gloucester</span>, <em>June 20, 1736</em>.<br />
</p>

<p>"This is a day much to be remembered; for, about noon, I was solemnly
admitted by good Bishop Benson, before many witnesses, into holy orders.
I endeavoured to behave with unaffected devotion. I trust I answered
every question from the bottom of my heart. I hope the good of souls
will be my only principle of action. Let come what will&mdash;life or death&mdash;I
shall henceforwards live like one who this day, in the presence of men
and angels, took the holy sacrament upon the profession of being inwardly
moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon me that ministration in the
Church. This I began with reading prayers to the prisoners in the
county gaol. Whether I myself shall ever have the honour of styling
myself a prisoner of the Lord, I know not; but indeed, my dear friend,
I can call heaven and earth to witness that, when the bishop laid his
hand upon me, I gave myself up to be a martyr for Him, who hung upon
the cross for me. Known unto Him are all future events and contingencies.
I have thrown myself blindfold, and I trust without reserve,
into His almighty hands."</p></blockquote>

<p>In such a spirit Whitefield entered upon his life-long
work. He coveted the ministry, and yet he seemed to
dread it. He was eager for the fight, but he trembled at
being sent before his Master called him. In one of the last
sermons that he preached in England, on August 30, 1769,
he told the crowd, in his London tabernacle, "I never
prayed against any corruption I had in my life, so much
as I did against going into holy orders. I have prayed
a thousand times till the sweat has dropped from my face
like rain, that God, of His infinite mercy, would not let
me enter the Church before He called me. I remember
once in Gloucester&mdash;I know the room&mdash;I look up at the
window when I am there and walk along the street&mdash;I know
the bedside, and the floor upon which I prostrated myself,
and cried, 'Lord, I cannot go. I shall be puffed up with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
pride, and fall into the condemnation of the devil. I am
unfit to preach in Thy great name. Send me not,
Lord, send me not yet.'"<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> No wonder that God honoured
the ministry of such a man. He sought no earthly emoluments
or rank. He durst not begin to preach until he was
satisfied of a call from God; but, receiving that, it was no
high-sounding boast, when he declared his readiness, not
only to become a prisoner, but a martyr for his Divine
Redeemer.</p>

<p>Three days after his ordination, he wrote to a friend as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Gloucester</span>, <em>June 23, 1736</em>.
</p>

<p>"Never a poor creature set up with so small a stock. When the good
Bishop Benson announced last year, in his visitation charge, that he would
ordain none under three and twenty, my heart leaped for joy. I thought
I should have time (as my intention was) to make at least a hundred
sermons, with which to begin my ministry. But so far from this being
the case, I have not a single one, except that which I made for a small
Society, and which I sent to a neighbouring clergyman, to convince him
how unfit I was to take upon me the important work of preaching. He
kept it for a fortnight, and then sent it back with a guinea for the loan of
it, telling me he had divided it into two, and had preached it morning
and evening to his congregation. With this sermon I intend to begin,
God willing, next Sunday, not doubting but that He, who increased a
little lad's loaves and fishes for the feeding of a great multitude, will, from
time to time, supply me with spiritual food for whatever congregations
He, in His all-wise providence, shall be pleased to call me to. Help,
help me, my dear friend, with your warmest addresses to the throne of
grace. At present, this is the language of my heart&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'A guilty, weak, and helpless worm,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Into Thy hands I fall;<br /></span>

<p>"Oh, cease not to pray for</p>

<p class="sig">
"Yours, etc.,<br />

"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>To another friend, he wrote, on June 26th, "To-morrow
I am to preach at Crypt, but, believe me, I shall displease
some, being determined to speak against their assemblies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
But I must tell them the truth, or otherwise I shall not be
a faithful minister of Christ." To-morrow came. Whitefield
preached his first sermon; and, three days afterwards,
wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Gloucester</span>, <em>June 30, 1736</em>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;Glory! glory! glory be ascribed to an Almighty,
Triune God. Last Sunday, in the afternoon, I preached my first sermon
in the Church of St. Mary de Crypt, where I was baptized, and also first
received the sacrament of the Lord's Supper. Curiosity, as you may
easily guess, drew a large congregation together. The sight at first a
little awed me; but I was comforted with a heartfelt sense of the Divine
presence, and soon found the unspeakable advantage of having been
accustomed to public speaking when a boy at school, and of exhorting
and teaching the prisoners, and poor people at their private houses, whilst
at the University. By these means, I was kept from being daunted over-much.
As I proceeded, I perceived the fire kindled, till at last, though
so young, and amidst a crowd who knew me in my childish days, I trust
I was enabled to speak with some degree of gospel authority. A few
mocked, but most for the present seemed struck; and I have since heard
that a complaint has been made to the bishop that I drove fifteen mad.
The worthy prelate, as I am informed, wished that the madness might
not be forgotten before next Sunday."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus did the renowned evangelist begin his ministry. Great
was the effect produced. A few mocked; but most of the
congregation displayed profound emotion, and, to use the
slang of the young preacher's enemies, "fifteen were driven
mad." Bishop Benson himself was probably not present;
but the next day Whitefield wrote, "Our good bishop was
pleased to give me another present of five guineas, a great
supply for one who had not a guinea in the world."</p>

<p>The reader can easily imagine the scene in the Church of
St. Mary de Crypt, where the usual congregations, as in
most other churches at that period, were far from overflowing.
Now there was a crowd&mdash;of whom? old men, who,
in years long since past, had been boon companions of
Whitefield's father; aged women, who remembered him
when he was a tiny infant in his mother's arms; topers,
not a few, whom, as a blue-aproned tapster, he had served in
the neighbouring public-house; schoolfellows with whom
he had been associated in many a merry spree; and a
mingled multitude who knew him only as a Gloucester boy,
who, by his own exertions, had made himself an honour to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
his native town. And what about the preacher? There he
stands, in a position which he had never occupied before, in
diaconal gown and bands, somewhat awed by the multitude
before him, and by a conviction of the responsibility of the
office which he was now assuming; but, at the same time,
nerved with fidelity to his Master, and comforted by a consciousness
that God was with him; his stature above the
middle height&mdash;slender, and yet well-proportioned; his
manner graceful; his features regular; his complexion
fair; his eyes small, lively, and of a dark-blue colour,
one of them with a squint, occasioned by the measles in
his childhood days; his voice unusual, both in melody and
strength, and its fine modulations accompanied by the exquisite
action of an accomplished orator. No wonder that
one of his uneducated hearers said "he preached like a
lion." The comparison was far from perfect. It expressed
the force and vehemence of that oratory which awed
his hearers, and made them tremble like Felix before
Paul; but it failed to convey an idea of the fervent and
melting charity, the earnestness of persuasion, and the
outpouring of redundant love, which characterised the preaching
of this youthful evangelist for the next four and thirty
years.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The subject of his first sermon was, "The Necessity and
Benefit of Religious Society;"<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> probably the same sermon
he afterwards preached before the Religious Societies, at
one of their quarterly meetings, in Bow Church, London, and
which was immediately published. "I shall displease some,"
said Whitefield in a letter already quoted, "for I am determined
to speak against their <em>assemblies</em>." How he fulfilled
his determination will be seen by the following extract from
his sermon:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I warn you of the great danger those are in, who, either by their subscriptions,
presence, or approbation, promote Societies of a quite opposite
nature to religion. And here I would not be understood to mean only
those public meetings which are designed manifestly for nothing else but
revellings and banquetings, for chambering and wantonness, and at which
a modest <em>heathen</em> would blush to be present; but also those seemingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
<em>innocent</em> entertainments and meetings which the <em>politer</em> part of the world
are so very fond of, and spend so much time in; but which, notwithstanding,
keep as many persons out of a sense of <em>true religion</em> as intemperance,
debauchery, or any other crime whatever. Indeed, whilst we are in this
world, we must have proper relaxations, to fit us both for the business of
our profession and religion. But then, for persons who call themselves
<em>Christians</em>, that have solemnly vowed at their <em>baptism</em>, to renounce the
<em>vanities</em> of this sinful world, and that are commanded in Scripture to
'<em>abstain from all appearance of evil</em>,' and to have their '<em>conversation in
heaven</em>,'&mdash;for such persons as these to support meetings that (to say no
worse of them) are vain and trifling, and have a natural tendency to draw
off our minds from God, is absurd, ridiculous, and sinful."</p></blockquote>

<p>This certainly was plain speaking in the first sermon of
a young man only a little more than twenty-one years of
age; but it is exactly what might be expected from an
Oxford Methodist; and something like it is greatly needed,
and would be highly useful in the pulpits of the present
day. Would that preachers now had more of the uncompromising,
bold, conscientious fidelity that marked the
young evangelist among his townsmen in the Church of
St. Mary de Crypt, Gloucester! Prophets "prophesy smooth
things; and the people love to have it so." It was otherwise
with Whitefield. "I must tell them the truth," said
he to his friend only a few hours before he preached his
first sermon, "I must tell them the truth, or I shall not be
a faithful minister of Christ." From this he never swerved.
To the end of life it was one of his great guiding principles.
It often brought upon him the ridicule of wicked wits,
and the displeasure of many who imagined themselves
Christians; but to all this Whitefield was indifferent. His
Master was Christ; and, "to his own Master," he was determined
to stand or fall (Rom. xiv. 4). Not long before his
death, he said, "I remember when I began to speak
against baptismal regeneration&mdash;in my first sermon, printed
when I was about twenty-two years old, or a little more&mdash;the
first quarrel many had with me was because I did not
say that all people who were baptized were born again. I
would as soon believe the doctrine of transubstantiation.
Can I believe that a person who, from the time of his baptism
to the time, perhaps, of his death, never fights against;
the world, the flesh, and the devil, and never minds one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
word of what his god-fathers and god-mothers promised for
him, is a real Christian? No, I can as soon believe that a
little wafer in the hands of a priest is the very blood and
bones of Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>So much then in reference to Whitefield's notable sermon
in the Church of St. Mary de Crypt, on June 27th, 1736,&mdash;the
first of upwards of eighteen thousand which he preached
before he died.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>On June 30th, he returned to Oxford, "where," he says,
"I was received with great joy by my religious friends.
For about a week, I continued in my servitor's habit, and then
took my degree of Bachelor of Arts. My dear and honoured
friends, the Reverend Messrs. John and Charles Wesley,
being now for some time embarked for Georgia, and one
or two more having taken orders, the interest of Methodism,
as it was then and is now termed, had visibly declined, and
very few of this reputed mad way were left at the University.
This somewhat discouraged me at times, but the
Lord Jesus supported my soul, and made me easy by giving
me a strong conviction that I was where He would have
me to be. I soon found my degree was of service to me,
as it gave me access to those I could not be free with when
in an inferior situation; and, as opportunity offered, I was
enabled to converse with them about the things which belonged
to the kingdom of God. The subscriptions for the
poor prisoners, which amounted to about £40 per annum,
were soon put into my hands. Two or three small charity
schools, maintained by the Methodists, were under my more
immediate inspection; which, with the time I spent in following
my studies, private retirement, and religious converse,
sweetly filled up the whole of my day, and kept me from the
too common complaint of having any time hang upon my
hands. The distributing money and books amongst the
poor prisoners, and employing such as could work, I
found was of admirable service. For hereby they were
kept from that worst of gaol diseases&mdash;idleness; and were
not only convinced that we bore a good will towards them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
but also led them, as it were, under an obligation to hear the
instructions we gave them. This practice was first taken up
by the Messrs. Wesley; and would to God all ordinaries of
prisons would copy their good example! They would
deserve well of the Commonwealth, and if actuated by the
love of God, would receive a glorious reward from Him, who
hath said, 'I was sick and in prison, and ye came unto
me.'"<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whitefield was happy&mdash;happy in himself, in his associates,
in his work, and in his hope of heaven. A week after his
arrival at Oxford, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The very idea of what we are to be in glory transports me. There,
there, we shall see the blessed Jesus, whom our souls have so eagerly
thirsted after in this life, surrounded with glory, and attended with myriads
of His holy angels, who will rejoice at our safe arrival to their holy mansions,
and with repeated echoes will welcome us to heaven. There, there,
we shall not only see, but live with Him, not for a day, a month, a year,
an age, but to all eternity. And who can tell the pleasure, comfort, peace,
joy, delight, and transport a glorified saint will feel in the possession of
his wished-for, longed-for, ever adorable, ever gracious, blessed, beloved
triune God, and that for ever? Surely the happiness will be so great,
that eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither can the heart of man conceive
the thousandth part thereof."</p></blockquote>

<p>For a few weeks Whitefield devoted himself to the work
of endeavouring to benefit the prisoners in Oxford gaol;
and then wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I began to be more than content in my present state of life, and had
thoughts of abiding at the University, at least for some years, to finish my
studies, and do what good I could amongst the poor despised Methodists.
But, by a series of unforeseen, unexpected, and unsought-for providences,
I was called from my beloved retirement to take a journey to the Metropolis.
Whilst I was an undergraduate, I was very intimate with one
Mr. Broughton,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> a professed Methodist, who had lately taken orders, and was
curate at the Tower of London. With him, when absent, I frequently corresponded;
and, when present, we took sweet counsel together, and walked to
the house of God as friends. Being called down into Hampshire, he wrote
me to be of good courage, and bid me hasten to town to officiate in his
absence. Accordingly, on Wednesday, August 4th, (the prisoners being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
provided for by the coming of Mr. Hervey,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> another young worthy Methodist,
who had lately taken Deacon's Orders,) with fear and trembling, I
obeyed the summons, and went in the stage coach to London. There
being no other passenger, I employed myself a good part of the way in
earnest supplication to the God of all grace to be my guide and comforter.
In the evening, I reached the Tower, and was kindly received by my dear
friend. The remainder of the week was spent in visiting Sir John
Philips, etc., who were too glad to see me. But God sent me something
to ballast it; for, as I passed along the streets, many came out of their
shops to see so young a person in a gown and cassock; and one cried
out, 'There's a boy parson;' which served to mortify my pride, and put
me also upon turning the apostolical exhortation into prayer, 'Let no
man despise thy youth.'"<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield remained two months in London, and preached
his first sermon there, on Sunday, August 8th, in Bishopsgate-street
Church. "As I went up the pulpit stairs," says he,
"almost all seemed to sneer at me on account of my youth;
but they soon grew serious and exceedingly attentive, and,
after I came down, shewed me great tokens of respect,
blessed me as I passed along, and made great enquiry who
I was."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>During his residence in the metropolis, Whitefield's work
in the Tower was to read prayers twice a week, catechize
and preach once, and visit the soldiers in the infirmary and
barracks daily. But, besides this, he read prayers every
evening at Wapping Chapel, and preached in Ludgate
prison every Tuesday. The chapel in the Tower was
crowded every Sunday, numbers of "religious friends," and
"several young men," coming "from divers parts of London,"
to hear him "discourse about the new birth and the necessity
of renouncing all in affection in order to follow Jesus
Christ."</p>

<p>When he had been about a month in town, letters came
from the Wesley brothers, and from Ingham, their fellow-labourer
in Georgia. Whitefield's soul was fired, and he
longed to join them. He consulted his friends; but they
"all agreed that labourers were needed at home; that, as yet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
he had no visible call to go abroad; and that it was his duty
not to be rash, but to wait and see what Providence might
point out to him." For the time being, this contented him;
and, Mr. Broughton having returned to London, Whitefield
went back to his charge at Oxford.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, he wrote the following characteristic letter to
Wesley, in Georgia, a letter which, though containing several
of the facts already narrated, is too interesting to be omitted
or abridged.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>September 2, 1736</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Very Dear and Rev. Sir</span>,&mdash;Being informed by Mr. Hutton that a
ship would soon sail towards your coasts, I thought it would be unpardonable
in me not to write to my spiritual father in Christ. But what shall
I begin with first? How shall I have room or time to relate to you a
thousandth part of those mercies which God, of His infinite goodness in
Christ Jesus, hath conferred upon me since I wrote last?</p>

<p>"If I mistake not, my last was dated from Gloucester, whence, after the
Lord Jesus had made me an instrument of forming a Society of some sincere
souls, God called me to Oxford again. From thence, after a stay of
three months, I returned to Gloucester. Directed by Divine Providence,
accompanied with the earnest solicitations of my friends, I entered into
holy orders. O pray, rev. sir, that I may be a faithful minister of Christ.</p>

<p>"You will naturally ask, 'Where hath it pleased God to settle you?'
Hear, rev. sir, and admire the Divine goodness towards the worst of
sinners. My friends had laid a plan, and the Bishop had united with
them, to have me settled in Gloucester. But I made it my earnest prayer
to Almighty God, through Christ, that I might either not go into orders, or
continue at Oxford some time longer, to fit me for the work of the
ministry. God was pleased to answer this prayer wonderfully; for, upon
my return to Oxford, most of our friends being called away to other parts
of the country, the Lord put it into the heart of our dear friend Mr.
Morgan<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> to inform Sir John Philips of our affairs; who immediately sent
me word that he would allow me £30 a year, if I would continue at
Oxford, and superintend the affairs of the Methodists. Providence
directed me to accept of his kind offer: accordingly, I preach every
Sunday to the prisoners, and follow your steps as close as possible.</p>

<p>"I am now at London, supplying the place of dear Mr. Broughton, who
is curate at the Tower; he being gone to Dummer, in Hampshire, to assist
dear Mr. Hutchins,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> who is gone to put his brother under the care of
pious Mr. Clayton.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sir John Philips is very much in our interest, and a blessed instrument
of supplying our wants, and of encouraging us in our weak endeavours to
promote the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. But few
friends are left at Oxford; yet the Lord hath given me great encouragement
out of His holy word, and I hope that some gownsmen will yet be
added to our number. The greatest opposition comes from the laity at
present. Yet, there is much good done. Our fellow-students are pretty
quiet, though our names stink among them. The Lord make us humble
and thankful!</p>

<p>"The stock for the prisoners is put into my hands. The Lord give me
wisdom and grace to distribute it as I ought.</p>

<p>"Farewell, rev. and dear sir. God be with you, and prosper you in all
your undertakings. May you be made a happy instrument of converting
the Gentiles. And, after you have served your blessed Master the
appointed time on earth, may you sit down with Him in eternal rest and
glory in heaven.</p>

"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>About the beginning of the month of October, 1736,
Whitefield returned to his "poor prisoners" at Oxford. He
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Oh what a delightful life did I lead here! What communion did I
daily enjoy with God! How sweetly did my hours in private glide away,
in reading and praying over Mr. Henry's Comment upon the Scriptures!
Nor was I alone happy; for several dear youths were quickened greatly,
and met daily at my room to build up each other in their most holy
faith."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Who were the youths in question? They evidently were
new converts, and therefore cannot be included among the
Oxford Methodists raised up prior to Wesley's embarkation
for Georgia. Whitefield has left us in the dark respecting
their names and their future life; but is it not reasonable
to infer that, as several of Wesley's friends ran an illustrious
career, so Whitefield's collegiate converts were also honoured,
by the great Head of the Church, in turning men from sin
to holiness, and from the power of Satan unto God? We
know something of the immense results of the influence
exerted by Wesley upon young men at Oxford, but are
entirely ignorant of the subsequent history of those whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Whitefield gathered together after Wesley left for Georgia.
Some of them were poor, and were indebted for their maintenance,
at least in part, to that woman of singular excellence,
the Lady Betty Hastings,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> sister of the ninth Earl of
Huntingdon, whose remarkable dowager became Whitefield's
chief friend and patroness. Whitefield writes concerning his
young associates and himself:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"God raised up friends for our temporal support. The late Honourable
Betty Hastings, that elect lady, allowed some of them two or three small
exhibitions. I also partook of her ladyship's bounty; and a gentleman,
whose heart was in an especial manner knit to me when in London, was
stirred up, without being solicited, to send me not only money for the
poor, but also a sufficiency to discharge debts I had contracted for books
before I took my degree. Upon his recommendation, also, I was chosen
a corresponding member of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge,
which I rejoiced in, as it gave me an opportunity of procuring
books at a cheap and easy rate for the poor people."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield's life at Oxford was useful and happy. He
loved the place, and was as reluctant to leave it as his friend
Wesley had been twelve months before; and yet his work
here was now nearly ended. Six weeks after his return
from London, he again took his departure, and henceforth
lived the life of an evangelistic wanderer. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"About the middle of November" (1736) "I was once more called from
my beloved, though little, scene of action. The Rev. Mr. Kinchin, now
with God,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> had lately been awakened, and accordingly resolved to associate
with the despised Methodists. He was then minister of Dummer,
in Hampshire; and, being likely to be chosen Dean of Corpus Christi
College, he desired me to come and officiate for him, till that affair should
be decided. By the advice of friends I went, and he came to supply my
place at Oxford. His parish consisting chiefly of poor and illiterate
people,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> my proud heart could not well brook it. I would have given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
all the world for one of my Oxford friends, and mourned for lack of them,
as a dove that has lost her mate. But upon giving myself to prayer, and
reading Mr. Law's excellent character of <em>Ouranius</em>, in his "Serious Call to
a Devout Life," my mind was reconciled to such conversation as the place
afforded me. Before I came to Dummer, Mr. Kinchin had used his
people, according to the rubric, to have public prayers twice a day,
namely, in the morning, it being winter season, before it was light; and
in the evening after the people returned from their work. He also catechised
the lambs of the flock daily, and visited from house to house. He
loved his people, and was beloved by them. I prosecuted his plan, and
generally divided the day into three parts&mdash;eight hours for study and
retirement, eight hours for sleep and meals, and eight hours for reading
prayers, catechising, and visiting the parish. The profit I reaped by
these exercises, and conversing with the poor country people, was unspeakable.
I frequently learnt as much by an afternoon's visit as in a
week's study."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield returned to Oxford on June 30, and purposed
to spend "some years" in that sect of learning; but already
he had been two months in London, and was now at Dummer,
officiating for his friend Kinchin. During his six
weeks' residence in this small Hampshire village, two events
occurred, one or other of which was likely to affect the whole
of his future life. First, he had the offer of "a very profitable
curacy in London." Had he accepted this, he probably,
instead of becoming one of the illustrious evangelists of the
eighteenth century, would have settled down into an earnest
and useful, but unknown, pastor of a parochial church and
congregation. The offer, to a penniless young parson, was
a tempting one; and the wonder is that it was not eagerly
embraced. Whitefield was not only without means, but
was actually in debt. On November 5, just before he went
to Dummer, he wrote to his friend Harris, the Gloucester
bookseller, "Herewith I have sent you £7, to pay for Mr.
Henry's Commentary. Dear Squire Thorold lately made
me a present of ten guineas; so that now (for ever blessed
be the Divine goodness!) I can send you more than I
thought I should be able to do. In time I hope to pay
the apothecary's bill." The man was without purse and
scrip; and yet, strangely enough, he declined the offer
of the "very profitable curacy" which had been made to
him.</p>

<p>The other event was the return of Charles Wesley from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Georgia. Charles landed in England on December 3; and,
on December 22, wrote in his journal: "I received a letter
from Mr. Whitefield, offering himself to go to Georgia."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
What happened during this brief interval of nineteen days?
Whitefield shall relate his own story. He says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"About the middle of December, a letter came from Mr. Broughton
informing me that Mr. Charles Wesley was arrived at London. Soon
after came a letter from Mr. Charles himself, wherein he informed me
that he was come over to procure labourers; but, added he, 'I dare not
prevent God's nomination.' In a few days after this came another letter
from Mr. John Wesley, wherein were these words&mdash;'Only Mr. Delamotte
is with me, till God shall stir up the hearts of some of His servants, who,
putting their lives in His hands, shall come over and help us, where the
harvest is so great, and the labourers so few. What if thou art the man,
Mr. Whitefield?' In another letter were these words&mdash;'Do you ask me
what you shall have? Food to eat, and raiment to put on; a house to
lay your head in, such as your Lord had not; and a crown of glory that
fadeth not away.' Upon reading this, my heart leaped within me, and, as
it were, echoed to the call. Many things concurred to make my way
clear. Mr. Kinchin was now elected Dean of Corpus Christi College,
and being thereby obliged to reside at Oxford, he willingly took upon
him the charge of the prisoners. Mr. Hervey was ready to serve the cure
at Dummer. Mr. Wesley was my dear friend, and I thought it would be
a great advantage to be under his tuition. Georgia was an infant, and
likely to be an increasing colony; and the Government seemed to have
its welfare much at heart. I had heard many Indians were near it, and
had thought it a matter of great importance that serious clergymen should
be sent there. Retirement and privacy were what my soul delighted in.
A voyage to sea would, in all probability, not do my constitution much
hurt; nay, I had heard that the sea was sometimes beneficial to weakly
people. And supposing the worst, as I must necessarily return to take
priests' orders, it would then be left to my choice whether I would fix in
my native country or go abroad any more. These things being thoroughly
weighed, I at length resolved to embark for Georgia; and knowing that
I should never put my resolution into practice, if I conferred with flesh
and blood, I wrote to my relations to inform them of my design, and
withal told them, 'if they would promise not to dissuade me from my
intended voyage, I would come and take a personal leave of them; if otherwise,
knowing my own weakness, I was determined to embark without
visiting them at all.' A few days after, Mr. Kinchin came to Dummer,
and introduced Mr. Hervey into the cure. They gave me some friendly
counsel; and, having spent the beginning of Christmas sweetly together,
and taken an affectionate leave of the Dummer people, I returned once
more to Oxford, to bid adieu to my friends, who were as dear to me as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
my own soul. My resolution at first a little shocked them; but having
reason to think, from my relation of circumstances, that I had a call
from Providence, most of them said, '<em>The will of the Lord be done!</em>'"<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Rubicon was passed. Young Whitefield, at the age
of twenty-two, resolved to be a missionary. In the quietude
of a small country village, he had time to think and to pray
about such a calling. Fortunately, there were no friends
at hand, with more affection than self-denying zeal, ready
to interfere with the yearnings of his big heart of mercy,
and to set aside his purpose. True, he had only six
months before resolved to live "some years" at Oxford,
to complete his studies, and to tend his prisoners; but
Wesley's characteristic letter had set his soul on fire, and
now he was determined to join his friend in Georgia.</p>

<p>To Whitefield, the year (1736) had been a most eventful
one. The first three months were spent in Gloucester, partly
in forming and establishing a religious Society; partly in
visiting the inmates of the county gaol; partly in reading
authors like Burkitt, Henry, Baxter, and Alleine; and, to a
great extent, in public and private prayer. There was no
prospect of his being admitted into orders, for he was only
twenty-one, and the bishop had publicly declared that he
would ordain no one under twenty-three. Indeed, Whitefield
himself shrank from immediate ordination, and prayed
with all his might against it. In the month of March, he
returned to Oxford, where his friends made him Wesley's
successor in the unendowed chaplaincy of Oxford prison,
and where, to his great surprise, he received from Sir John
Philips the offer of a gratuity of £30 a year. In June, he
was ordained by Bishop Benson. In July, his University
made him a Bachelor of Arts. In August and September,
the "Boy-Parson" was employed in preaching in London
churches and in London prisons, and with such success that
people from all parts of the vast city began to flock together
to hear him. In November, the youthful preacher, who, to
some extent, had startled London, became the temporary
pastor of a pigmy parish of less than three hundred souls;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and here, in the retirement he loved so much, he suddenly,
but not without thought and prayer, determined that he
would embark for Georgia. As soon as possible he hastened
back to Oxford; his collegiate friends, at first, were "a little
shocked," but afterwards acquiesced; and he himself wrote
to Charles Wesley the following letter&mdash;a letter which will
fitly close the present chapter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Oxon</span>, <em>December 30, 1736</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dearest Sir</span>,&mdash;Last night I returned from a weeping flock at
Dummer, and met with a grateful, sweet reception from my Oxon friends.
But, alas! how transient are our visits in this life! for to-morrow I purpose,
God willing, to set out for Gloucester; or otherwise I shall hardly
see the bishop, who, I hope, will contribute something towards assisting
the Americans. Add to this, that friends promise not to dissuade me
from my enterprise; and I have a brother, I believe, now there, that
comes on purpose to see me; so that all here bid me hasten away. O
may such speedy removes teach me to be every moment ready at my
blessed Master's call; and remind me that I have here no continuing
city, but seek one to come!</p>

<p>"I have great reason to bless God for sending me to Dummer. It has,
I think, been an excellent preparation for Georgia. It has brought me to
live alone, and much improved both my outward and inward man. I
have written to Salmon, and will, God willing, shortly send to Hall.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> No
one but myself is ready to go from Oxford. Dear Mr. Hutchins will go
hereafter, I believe; but his time, as yet, is not fully come. I trust God
will give me strength to throw myself blindfold into His hands, and
permit Him to do with me whatsoever seemeth good in His sight. All
friends like the German Hymn admirably. Happy shall I be if my lot is
cast amongst such pious souls;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> but, I think, God calls me in a particular
manner to assist your brother.</p>

<p>"My friend will not take it amiss, if I enquire why he chooses to be
secretary to Mr. Oglethorpe, and not rather go where labourers are so
much wanted, in the character of a missionary. Did the bishop ordain
us, my dear friend, to write bonds, receipts, etc., or to preach the Gospel?
Or dare we not trust God to provide for our relations, without endangering,
or at least retarding, our spiritual improvement? But I go too far. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Habe
me excusatum.</i> You know I was always heady and self-willed.</p>

<p>"I hear you are to be in Gloucester next week. Will dear Mr. Charles
take a bed with me at Mr. Harris's? I believe he will be welcome. You
will write next post, if convenient, and direct for me to Mr. Harris's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>

<h2><em>A YEAR OF PREACHING.</em></h2>

<h3>1737.</h3>


<p>Whitefield wished and expected to embark for
Georgia without delay; but, by a series of unforeseen
occurrences, he was detained in England during
the whole of the year 1737. In some respects this was the
most important period of his life. He had transferred the
care of the prisoners at Oxford to Dean Kinchin. James
Hervey had succeeded him in the curacy at Dummer. He
had no parochial charge, and probably he wished for none.
At the early age of twenty-two, he was an episcopally
ordained evangelist, ready and eager to preach whenever
and wherever an opportunity of doing so was presented.
The year was spent in a continued succession of public
services, which literally startled the nation. He was a
new phenomenon in the Church of England. All eyes
were fixed upon him. His popularity in Bristol, London,
and other places was enormous. His preaching became
the subject of public remark; his name, hitherto
almost entirely unknown, became a household word.
Thousands and tens of thousands were making enquiries
concerning him. His position was perilous. Popular favour
might have ruined him; but the grace of God preserved
him. This year's evangelistic labours in England gave a
bias to the whole of his future life. Never afterwards did
he desire church preferment. As an ordained clergyman,
the whole of his subsequent career was irregular. He was
a <em>gospel rover</em>. No power on earth could confine him to a
single parish or a single church. He prepared the way for
Methodist itinerancy. His marvellous preaching brought
Methodism into a notoriety far greater than it had hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
attained. Though Wesley, in learning and in mental acquirements
generally, was much superior to young Whitefield, and
though he was his equal in self-denying and laborious piety,
it may be fairly doubted whether Wesley's preaching in
1739 would have attracted the attention which it did, if
Whitefield had not preceded him in 1737. Whitefield's
appearance, voice, elocution, and pulpit eloquence, drew
around him thousands who, in the first instance, cared but little
about his doctrines. They came to see and hear the orator;
they returned more impressed with <em>what</em> he said, than <em>how</em>
he said it. The doctrines of the man soon excited as much
attention as the man himself; and when, in the two years
following, his more sober-minded friends, the Wesley brothers,
came preaching the same great truths, the people&mdash;friends
and foes&mdash;were as eager to hear them as they previously had
been to hear him.</p>

<p>That England needed such a ministry as that of Whitefield
and the Wesleys, no one doubts. It would be the
height of bigoted absurdity to say or to imagine that, when
they commenced their marvellous career, England had no
converted ministers except themselves.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The episcopal
charges, the sermons, and other publications of the period,
afford ample proof that, in the pulpits of the Church of
England especially, there were a considerable number of
not only able and learned, but thoroughly earnest and godly
men. The reader must not forget that, at this very time, the
see of London was filled by a man (Edmund Gibson), who,
in a conscientious discharge of duty, had offended George
the Second, not only by inveighing from the pulpit against
masquerades, to which that monarch was much attached,
but by procuring the signatures of several bishops to an
address to the throne, "praying for the entire abolition of
such pernicious diversions." It is true, that this selfsame
bishop, in 1739, warned the people of his diocese against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the enthusiasm of the Methodists; and, at a later period,
published a pamphlet, in which he animadverted somewhat
strongly on "the conduct and behaviour" of the members
of this rising sect; but there is nothing, in either of the
publications just mentioned, contrary to the fact that Dr.
Gibson was an able, earnest, godly man. Besides Gibson,
there was Sherlock, successively bishop of Bangor, Salisbury,
and London, a man of great ability, whose sermons
contain fine specimens of pulpit eloquence, and who was
even more eminent for his piety than his learning. There
was the celebrated Dr. Waterland, than whom orthodoxy
never had a more valiant defender, a man of immense
learning, who was once offered a bishopric, but modestly
declined it. There was Bishop Butler, who, while rector of
Stanhope, in 1736, published his great work, "The Analogy
of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the Constitution and
Course of Nature." There was Archbishop Secker, the
intimate friend of Bishop Butler, and who, for nearly three
years, under an assumed name, carried on with Wesley
a friendly correspondence on some of the most vital truths
of the Christian religion. There was the well-known Dr.
Jortin, an able and voluminous author, and a sincere and
devout Christian. Many others might be mentioned, all
learned and deeply pious, though, perhaps, not preaching
with clearness the characteristic doctrines of the Methodists.
Ever since the days of Dr. Horneck and Bishop Beveridge,
there had been in the pulpits of the Established Church a
considerable number of earnest preachers, resembling in
spirit, fidelity, and sentiment, the men who, in 1677, had
been the means of instituting the Religious, or, as they might
be termed, the Pre-Methodist Societies, which had existed
and multiplied, in various parts of the kingdom, during the
last sixty years.</p>

<p>The Dissenters, also, were not without talented and useful
ministers. At the very time, when Whitefield commenced
his illustrious career, Dr. Isaac Watts was still rendering
important service to the Church of Christ; Dr. Philip
Doddridge was at the height of his Christian usefulness;
Dr. Nathaniel Lardner, the learned author of the "Credibility
of the Gospel History," was preaching at Crutched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Friars; Dr. Samuel Chandler, another able writer, was
lecturer at the Old Jewry Chapel; Daniel Neal, the historian
of the Puritans, was pastor of a congregation in
Jewin Street; and Dr. John Gill, the ultra-Calvinist, was now
minister at Horsley Down, and writing his ponderous commentary
on the sacred Scriptures.</p>

<p>All these were pious, able, useful men. Their service to
the cause of Christ was great. Their names and memories
can never perish. But, notwithstanding all that has just
been said, and all that might be added, there cannot
be doubt that England, Ireland, Wales, and Scotland,&mdash;the
Established Church, the Presbyterians, and the Dissenters,&mdash;all
greatly needed a ministry like that of Whitefield and his
friends, the Oxford Methodists. Speaking generally, to the
churches of the land might have been appropriately applied
the language once addressed to the church in Sardis: "I
know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and
art dead." The country was filled with abounding wickedness,
in its most flagrant forms; and Christian men were at
their wits' end how to stem the disastrous deluge. The
secular press of the period&mdash;newspapers and magazines&mdash;contain
abundant evidence of this. Extracts and summaries,
to this effect, have already been published in "The Life and
Times of Wesley," and it would be wearisome to repeat
them here; but there is another class of evidence which,
without any repetition, may be fitly introduced.</p>

<p>Almost from the beginning of his career, Whitefield was
<em>practically</em> a Dissenter; and there can hardly be a doubt,
that, directly and indirectly, he was immensely useful in
reviving the religious life of Dissenting churches. What
was their condition when he commenced his ministry? Dr.
Watts was now sixty-three years of age. He had long been
the sweet singer of, at least, one branch of the Dissenting
community, and, for forty years, had been pastor of a congregation
in Mark Lane, London, occupying, as their successor,
the pulpit of the Rev. Joseph Caryl, Dr. John Owen,
the Rev. David Clarkson, and Dr. Isaac Chauncey. No
man was better qualified to form a correct estimate of the
religious state of the Dissenters generally than himself.
What is his testimony on this grave and momentous subject?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
In the year 1731, he published his "Humble Attempt towards
the Revival of Practical Religion among Christians,
by a Serious Address to Ministers and People." The following
remarkable extracts are taken from that publication:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Is this a day when we should leave the peculiar articles of the religion
of Christ out of our ministrations, when the truth of them is boldly called
in question and denied by such multitudes who dwell among us? Is this
a proper time for us to forget the name of Christ in our public labours,
when the witty talents and reasonings of men join together, and labour
hard to cast out His sacred name with contempt and scorn? Is it so seasonable
a practice in this age to neglect these evangelic themes, and to preach
up virtue, without the special principles and motives with which Christ
has furnished us, when there are such numbers amongst us who are fond
of heathenism, who are endeavouring to introduce it again into a Christian
country, and to spread the poison of infidelity through a nation called by
His name? If this be our practice, our hearers will begin to think that
infidels may have some reason on their side, and that the glorious doctrines
of the gospel of Christ are not so necessary as our fathers thought
them. Will this be our glory, to imitate the heathen philosophers, and to
drop the gospel of the Son of God? to be complimented by unbelievers
as men of superior sense and as deep reasoners, while we abandon the faith
of Jesus, and starve the souls of our hearers by neglecting to distribute to
them this bread of life which came down from heaven?" (p. 20.)</p>

<p>"The world has been so long imposed upon by shameful additions of men
to the gospel of Christ, that they seem now to be resolved to bear them no
longer. Because so many irrational notions and follies have been mixed
up with the Christian scheme, it is now a modish humour of the age to
renounce almost everything that reason doth not discover, and to reduce
Christianity itself to little more than the light of nature and the dictates of
reason. Under this sort of influence, there are some who are believers of
the Bible and of the Divine mission of Christ, and who dare not renounce
the gospel itself; and yet they interpret some of the peculiar and express
doctrines of it, into so poor, so narrow, and so jejune a meaning, that they
suffer but little to remain, beyond the articles of natural religion" (p. 25).</p></blockquote>

<p>The two foregoing extracts were addressed to ministers,
and are lamentably appropriate at the present day. The
following were addressed to the people; and, though mostly
put in the form of queries, they are so put as to be equivalent
to plain and positive assertions:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The persons whom I would, at this time, compare together, are the
common professors of religion in the Church of England, and the common
professors among Dissenters, the bulk of the people both on the one side
and on the other; and I would fain excite you, who call yourselves Protestant
Dissenters, to bethink yourselves concerning the sensible decay of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
real goodness that is found amongst you, in order to awaken you to the
warmest zeal and utmost endeavours to revive languishing and dying
religion" (p. 56).</p>

<p>"O let it never be said by those who differ from us, and especially by
those who hate us, 'These are the persons who profess purity in worship,
but see how vicious they live! They are as much given to luxury in diet,
to extravagance and vanity in dress, to everything that is sensual and
voluptuous, or gay and vain, as any of us who do not make such pretences
to religion; they are as loose, as frothy, as unsavoury, in their discourse,
as any of their neighbours; they have no more inclination, or at least no
more courage, to speak one word for God and religion than we have; they
are as ready to over-reach those who deal with them, and to cheat and
defraud in matters of trade, as any amongst us'" (p. 79).</p>

<p>"Shall I address myself with freedom to the parents and governors of
families? Are you as solicitous to keep up the seasons of worship in your
households as your fathers were? Are there not too many among you,
who scarce ever call upon God in their families at all, unless it be perhaps
on a Lord's-day evening? Have you learned to change the course of
nature, to turn night into day, and day into night? Can the seasons of
family worship be well maintained, or can the master perform it with a
clear head and a pious heart, if he indulges his amusements in public
drinking-houses till the hour of midnight approaches?" (p. 87.)</p>

<p>"Is not bankruptcy reckoned too small a crime amongst the Dissenters,
as well as amongst their neighbours? and that where there can be found
no other reason for it, but that they have lived too fast; they have affected
the luxuries of life in their dress and furniture, food, equipage, and attendance,
and would vie with their neighbours in splendour, grandeur, and
expense, where the circumstances of their estate or trade have not been
able to afford it? Or, perhaps they have frequented taverns early and
late; they have habituated themselves to a morning whet, to prepare for
some luxurious dish at noon; they have indulged their pleasures, and
neglected their shop. Or, it may be they have sought to grow rich at once
by plunging into trade and debt beyond all proportion of their estate, or
possibility of payment, if they should meet with any disappointing accident.
They have too often assumed the character of <em>the wicked</em>, who <em>borrows
when he knows not how to pay again</em>. They have supplied their shops
with goods, their tables with costly provisions, their houses with rich furniture,
and their families with shining apparel, out of the purses of their
credulous neighbours. A man who should have been found in the practice
of half these vices would never have been called a Dissenter in the days
of our fathers; and it is a heavy shame, and an in supportable disgrace,
that there should be any such characters in our day that should wear the
name of a Nonconformist" (p. 89).</p>

<p>"I proceed to the sixth and last thing wherein the Protestant Dissenters
were wont eminently to distinguish themselves, and that is in their abstaining
from those gayer vanities and dangerous diversions of their age, which
border so near vice and irreligion, that sometimes it is pretty hard to
separate them. Such are many of our <em>midnight assemblies</em>, <em>midnight balls</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
<em>lewd and profane comedies</em>, <em>masquerades</em>, <em>public gaming tables</em>, <em>and deep
play</em>. In this respect, shall I put the question, '<em>What do you more than
others?</em>' It was a constant and known mark of a Protestant Dissenter in
former days, to refuse attendance upon any of these kinds of diversions.
I hope we have not utterly lost this piece of Puritanism amongst us. I
am bold to say, that if our fathers were in any degree too rigid and austere
in pronouncing these things absolutely sinful, and in their utter prohibition
of themselves and their households from ever once attending upon them;
it is certain that we their children are much more criminal in giving too
great a loose to many of these diversions. Can you not name the
Dissenters who waste that time at a play-house, or a vain assembly of
merriment, at a public gaming table, or a dancing room,&mdash;that time, I say,
which belongs to God or their families? who spend those seasons in
late visits and private balls, or at cards, whereby evening devotion is utterly
excluded? who can wear out whole hours in these foolish and perilous
recreations, and complain they have no time for prayer? Can you point
to no persons, who are members of Dissenting churches, who entice their
acquaintance to these vanities? Do you know no mothers who lead their
little daughters thither, nor fathers who permit their sons to go without
control? And do they know, or will they not believe, that the road to
lewdness and impiety, to ruin and beggary, lies through these scenes of
dangerous diversion?</p>

<p>"To sum up all in general, your fathers had an honourable character,
and a very great reputation, even among the looser parts of the nation, for
strict virtue, for exemplary and sincere godliness, beyond the common
multitude of those who called themselves the Established Church; for if
any person appeared to be strictly religious, and fearful of indulging any
sin,&mdash;if he was scrupulous of any doubtful practice, or attempted to give an
admonition to the sons of vice, he was presently called a Puritan, or a
Fanatic, or Presbyterian, by way of reproach. This honour was a frequent
tribute paid by the ungodly world to the superior virtue and merit
of your ancestors and their profession of nonconformity. What is become
of this your reputation? Have you lost your good name? Have you sold
your glory for the indulgence of the follies and vanities of life? Have you
fallen into such a neglect of strict religion as leaves no other distinction
between you and your neighbours, besides your worship once a week in a
different place and manner? It is time, my friends, when religion is sunk
into such a universal decay in the nation, to enquire whether we have not
suffered it to decay amongst us also, and whether we are not sharers in
the common degeneracy. If the bulk of the nation be gone far in the
neglect of virtue and godliness, let us not dare to follow the multitude, and
make our profession of separation an empty name, and our pretence to
purer worship a mere badge of hypocrisy" (p. 91).</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was the significant language of the most notable
Dissenting minister of the age, when Methodism was taking
its rise in the Oxford University. Dr. Watts saw the retrogression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of the Nonconformists, and had fidelity enough to
speak of it.</p>

<p>Further testimony respecting the need of a ministry like
that of Whitefield and his friends is hardly needed; but the
following, from another class of witnesses, may not be unacceptable.</p>

<p>In a sermon preached before the House of Lords, at the
Abbey Church in Westminster, on Friday, December 8, 1721,
by the Bishop of Norwich, the following paragraph occurs:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Notwithstanding the dismal calamities we have already felt, wickedness
still overflows the nation like a mighty deluge, so as to overspread all
ranks and orders of men amongst us. Do not our eyes behold it continually,
in the open atheism, profaneness, and impiety; in the hypocrisy and
dissimulation; in the contempt of God and His holy worship; in the
profanation of His holy day; in the bold infidelity, and denying the Lord
that bought us; in the dreadful abuse of God's great and glorious name,
by the horrid oaths, curses, and imprecations, which are heard continually
in our streets, and in the places of concourse and conversation; in the
practice of the most filthy and abominable lusts; in the lewdness and
luxury; in the oppression and injustice; in the implacable malice and
hatred of one towards another; and in our senseless divisions and animosities,
without cause and without end, which reign everywhere?"</p></blockquote>

<p>This was strong language to be used in such a place, and
before such an audience; and the following, respecting the
literature of the day, by another dignitary of the Church of
England, Dr. Stanhope, Dean of Canterbury, and Chaplain
to his Majesty, is quite as strong. In a sermon, preached in
the parish church of St. Pancras, in 1723, Dean Stanhope
speaks of many of the productions of the press, as "those
monsters of irreligion and profaneness, of heresy and schism,
of sedition and scandal, of malice and detraction, of obscenity
and ribaldry, which mercenary wretches, void of shame, published
for the sake of a paltry present gain, thereby, not only
debauching the principles of the age, but, if such detestable
compositions can survive so long, propagating the poison to
posterity, and furnishing the devil with nets and snares, for
drawing in, and sinking down to hell, numbers of unwary
souls, which are yet unborn."</p>

<p>In a sermon, preached in Salisbury Cathedral, in 1745,
and published at the request of the mayor and corporation,
Bishop Sherlock remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Let not <em>me</em> be the accuser of my nation, but let every man recollect
what he has heard, and read, and seen within the compass of a few years.
Surely the gospel of Christ Jesus was never treated with greater malice
and contempt, by Jews or heathens, than it has been in this Christian
country. Think not that I am condemning a sober enquiry into the truth
of religion; but what shall we say for the undisguised profaneness and
blasphemy that have swarmed from the press? Many instances might
be given; but one can never be forgotten, where the noblest and most
exalted hymn of Christian devotion<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> in the world has been perverted to
the highest impiety and blasphemy, that the wickedness or malice of
man's heart can conceive. This and other crimes are indeed chargeable
on the authors; but how deplorable must the state of the nation be,
when men find encouragement to provide such entertainment for the
public!</p>

<p>"Look into common life, and see what is become of that sense of
religion which once animated the people. When popery was breaking
in upon us, our churches were crowded. Is it so now? Is not Sunday
become a day of diversion to the great ones, and a day of laziness to the
little ones? And has not this been manifestly followed by a great increase
of great wickedness and violence among the lower people? Theft and
robbery, which used to be secret crimes, now appear armed in our streets;
and are supported by numbers strong enough to defy the power of the
magistrates."</p></blockquote>

<p>These are melancholy statements; but, coming from such
men, it is impossible to doubt their truthfulness. Speaking
generally, the churches of the land were sunk into apathy
and worldliness, and the people, with few exceptions, were
not only regardless of religion, but saturated with infidelity
and wickedness. No wonder that the souls of men like
Whitefield were stirred to their deepest depths. The country
needed a religious agency which it possessed not; and
God, in infinite mercy, supplied the want.</p>

<p>It is time to return to Whitefield. As usual, he shall
relate his own story. He was eager to embark for Georgia.
He had consulted his friends at Oxford, and had secured
their approval. He wished, however, to have the judgment
of Dr. Benson, who had ordained him; and, hence, writes as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On New Year's Day, 1737, I went to Gloucester, to hear the bishop's
opinion, and to take leave of my mother and other relations. His lordship
received me, as he always did, like a father, approved of my design,
and wished me much success. My own relations, at first, were not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
passive. My aged mother wept sore; and others urged what pretty preferment
I might have, if I would stay at home. But, at length, they grew
more quiet, and, finding me so fixed, gainsayed no longer.</p>

<p>"During my stay here, I began to grow a little popular. God gave
me honour for a while, even in my own country. I preached twice on the
Sabbaths. Congregations were very large, and the power of God attended
the word; and some, I have reason to believe, were truly converted.</p>

<p>"In about three weeks, I went to Bristol, to take leave of some of my
relations there. As it was my constant practice, go where I would, to
attend on the daily public offices of the Church, I went, the Thursday
after my coming, to hear a sermon at St. John's Church. Whilst the
psalm was singing, after the prayers, the minister came to my seat, and
asked me to give the congregation a sermon. Having my notes about
me, I complied. The hearers seemed startled, and, after sermon, enquiry
was made, who I was? The next day there was another lecture at St.
Stephen's. Many crowded thither in expectation of hearing me again.
The lecturer asked me to preach. I again complied; and the alarm
given here was so general, that, on the following Lord's-day, many of all
denominations were obliged to return from the churches, where I preached,
for want of room. Afterwards, I was called by the mayor to preach
before him and the corporation. For some time following, I preached
all the <em>lectures</em> on week-days, and twice on Sundays, besides visiting the
Religious Societies. The word, through the mighty power of God, was
sharper than a two-edged sword. The doctrine of the new birth and
justification by faith in Jesus Christ (though I was not so clear in it as
afterwards) made its way like lightning into the hearers' consciences.
The arrows of conviction stuck fast; and my whole time, between one
lecture and another, except what was spent in necessary refreshment, was
wholly occupied in talking with people under religious concern. Large
offers were made me, if I would stay at Bristol. All wondered that I
would go to Georgia; and some urged that, if I had a mind to convert
Indians, I might go among the Kingswood colliers, and find Indians
enough there. But none of these things moved me. Having put my
hand to the plough, I was determined, through Divine grace, not to look
back.</p>

<p>"During my stay at Bristol, I made a little elopement to Bath, where I
was kindly received by a dear friend, the Rev. Mr. Chapman,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and some
elect and honourable women who befriended the Oxford Methodists. I
preached at the Abbey Church twice. The late Dr. Cockman was pleased
to thank me for my sermon; and application was made to me by several
to print both my discourses."</p></blockquote>

<p>These facts, so ingenuously and simply related, are marvellous.
Here was a young man, fresh from college, recently
ordained, without patronage, and belonging to the despised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Methodists, literally agitating, what was then, in point of
population, the second city in the nation; while, at Bath,
England's most fashionable resort, with "Beau" Nash, the
accomplished rake, at the head of it, the Methodist stripling
was gladly welcomed to the cathedral pulpit! This crisis
in Whitefield's history was a dangerous one. The adulations
of the multitude might easily have disturbed the
religious equilibrium of the young preacher, and, thereby,
damaged him for life. He felt his peril, and prayed to be
preserved from it. The following, written at the time to his
friend Harris, at Gloucester, is worth quoting:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Bristol</span>, <em>February 10, 1737</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;What shall I say? I cannot be with you this week.
Methinks it would be almost sinful to leave Bristol at this critical juncture,
there being now a prospect of making a very considerable collection for
the poor Americans. The whole city seems to be alarmed. Churches
are as full on week-days as they used to be on Sundays, and on Sundays
are so full, that many, very many, are obliged to go away, because they
cannot come in. Oh pray, dear Mr. Harris, that God would always keep
me humble, and fully convinced that I am nothing without Him, and that
all the good which is done upon earth, God doeth it Himself. Quakers,
Baptists, Presbyterians, all come to hear the word preached. Sanctify it,
Holy Father, to Thy own glory and Thy people's good!"</p></blockquote>

<p>From Bristol, Whitefield proceeded to Gloucester, Oxford,
and London. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was now about the middle of February. Lent was at hand, and I
was obliged to be at Oxford to perform the remainder of my college
exercise, which they call <em>Determining</em>. I went through Gloucester, and
abode there a week, visiting the prisoners, and encouraging the awakened
souls. Having stayed about ten days at the University, I took, as I
thought, my last farewell of my dear friends, and came to London in the
beginning of March, in order to wait upon James Oglethorp, Esq., and
the honourable trustees.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The former introduced me to his Grace the
present Archbishop of Canterbury;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and the Rev. Mr. Arthur Bedford,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
at the desire of the latter, went with me to the present Bishop of London.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
Both approved of my going abroad; the former was pleased to say, 'He
would take particular notice of such as went to Georgia, if they did not
go out of any sinister view.' This put me upon enquiry what were my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
motives in going? And, after the strictest examination, my conscience
answered, 'Not to please any man living upon earth, nor out of any
sinister view, but simply to comply with what I believe to be Thy will,
O God, and to promote Thy glory, thou great Shepherd and Bishop of
souls.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield expected to sail for Georgia at once; but in
this he was disappointed. The following letter, addressed
"To the Rev. Mr. John Wesley, minister at Savannah," has
not before been published:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>March 17, 1737</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend Sir</span>,&mdash;Though I have had thoughts of going to Georgia
for above these seven months, yet I never resolved till I received your
kind letter.</p>

<p>"I am now in London. My intention in coming hither was to wait on
the trustees and the bishop; and both, I believe, will approve of my going.
We are not likely to set sail till July. Your brother intends returning with

<p>"Next week, or the week after, I go to Bath, in order to preach a
public sermon for the poor Americans. God has inclined the hearts of
His people to give me above £200 already, in private charities, and more,
I hope, will still be collected.</p>

<p>"Innumerable are the blessings our God has poured on me since I saw

<p>Several things are noticeable in this short letter. Except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
a general allusion to his ministerial success, there is not a
word respecting his marvellous popularity in the city of
Bristol. He was already collecting money for the needy
inhabitants of Georgia, though his autobiography does not
mention this. He addresses Wesley scarcely as a familiar
friend, but in language strikingly deferential. He expresses
his intention to proceed to Bath, an intention which, for the
present, had to be abandoned. Hence the following continuation
of his autobiography:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I continued in London about three weeks, waiting for Mr. Oglethorpe,
who expected to sail every day. In this season, I preached more frequently
than when there before. Many more came to hear me; and the last
Sunday I was in town I read prayers twice, and preached four times. But,
finding Mr. Oglethorpe was not likely to go for some time, and having
lain under particular obligation to the Rev. Mr. Sampson Harris,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> minister
of Stonehouse, in Gloucestershire, I went down thither, at his request, to
supply his place, whilst he came up to dispatch some affairs in town.</p>

<p>"Here was a little sweet Society, who had heard me preach at an adjacent
town, and had wrestled with God, if it was His will, to send me amongst
them. They received me with joy, and most of the parishioners were very
civil, when I came to visit them from house to house. I found them more
knowing than I expected. Their pastor had catechized the little ones in
the summer season, and expounded the four lessons every Lord's-day in
the church. I followed his good example, and found great freedom and
assistance given me both in my public and private administrations.
Having the use of the parsonage house, I expounded every night. Many
that were not parishioners came to hear, and were edified. On Sundays,
besides expounding the lessons, catechising and preaching, I repeated my
sermons to the Society. Neither church nor house could contain the
people that came. I found uncommon manifestations granted me from
above. Early in the morning, at noonday, evening, and midnight, nay,
all the day long, did the blessed Jesus visit and refresh my heart. Could
the trees of a certain wood near Stonehouse speak, they would tell what
sweet communion I and some others enjoyed there with the ever blessed
God. Sometimes, as I was walking, my soul would make such sallies as
though it would go out of the body. At other times, I was so overpowered
with a sense of God's infinite majesty, that I was constrained to throw
myself prostrate on the ground. One night, when I had been expounding
to many people, it happened to lighten exceedingly, and some being afraid
to go home, I thought it my duty to accompany them, and improve the
occasion, to stir them up to prepare for the coming of the Son of man. In
my return to the parsonage, whilst others were rising from their beds,
frightened almost to death, I and a poor, but pious, countryman were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the field exulting in our God, and longing for the time when Jesus shall be
revealed from heaven in a flame of fire. Every week the congregations
increased; and on Ascension-day, when I took my leave, their sighs and
tears almost broke my heart."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Such was the active and happy life of Whitefield during
the two months that he spent at Stonehouse. In letters to
the brother of the clergyman for whom he was officiating, he
wrote:&mdash;"Be pleased to send me the 'Poor Country Curate,'
and Flavel's 'Husbandry Spiritualized.' I know not what
to do for want of a clock in the house.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The country
now looks like a second paradise. This seems the pleasantest
place I ever was in. Surely I can never be
thankful enough for being sent hither. People flock to
hear the word of God from the neighbouring villages,
as well as our own. They gladly receive me into their
houses. I have no let or hindrance to my ministerial
business. Stonehouse people and I agree better and better.
I believe we shall part weeping. Your observations on the
weather were pertinent and spiritual. Honest James and I
were out in the midst of the lightning, and never were more
delighted in our lives. May we be as well pleased when the
Son of God cometh to judgment!"</p>

<p>On leaving Stonehouse, exultant Whitefield went to
Bristol. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The incumbent of Stonehouse being returned from London, and the
people of Bristol having given me repeated invitations, since the time of
my embarking was deferred, I paid them a second visit on May 23rd.
Multitudes came on foot, and many in coaches, a mile without the city,
to meet me; and almost all saluted and blessed me as I went along the
street.</p>

<p>"Upon my coming here, I received letters from London, informing me
that Mr. Oglethorpe would not embark these two months. This gladdened
many hearts, though I cannot say that it did mine; for I counted the
hours, as it were, till I went abroad. I preached, as usual, about five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
times a week; but the congregations grew, if possible, larger and larger.
It was wonderful to see how the people hung upon the rails of the organ
loft, climbed upon the leads of the church, and made the church itself so
hot with their breath, that the steam would fall from the pillars like drops
of rain. Sometimes, almost as many would go away, for want of room,
as came in; and it was with great difficulty that I got into the desk, to
read prayers or preach. Persons of all denominations flocked to hear.
Persons of all ranks, not only publicly attended my ministry, but gave me
private invitations to their houses. A private Society or two were erected.
I preached and collected for the poor prisoners in Newgate twice or
thrice a week; and many made me large offers if I would not go
abroad.</p>

<p>"During my stay here, I paid another visit to Bath, and preached
three times in the Abbey Church, and once in Queen's Chapel. People
crowded, and were affected as at Bristol; and God stirred up some elect
ladies to give upwards of £160 for the poor of Georgia."</p></blockquote>

<p>At this distance of time, it is impossible to ascertain who
were the "elect ladies" here mentioned. Bath was the
resort of all kinds of ladies, titled and untitled, converted
and unconverted, moral and immoral. How many of Bath's
distinguished female visitors flocked to the Abbey Church
to hear the young Christian orator, there is no evidence to
show; and it is equally difficult to determine whether any
of these casual acquaintances became lasting friends. It is
said, that the witty and eccentric Lady Townshend, the
mother of the first Marquess Townshend and of the famous
Charles Townshend, was the first titled lady who extolled
Whitefield's preaching;<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and it is certain that, within a few
years after this visit to the city of Bath, his aristocratic
hearers and admirers included the Countess of Huntingdon,
the Duchess of Ancaster, Lady Cobham, the Duchess of
Buckingham, the Duchess of Queensbury, Lady Lisburne,
Lady Hinchinbroke, and others, some of whom will be
further noticed in succeeding pages.</p>

<p>This second preaching visit to Bristol lasted for a month.
His entrance was a spectacle seldom seen; and his departure
was quite as marvellous. The youthful evangelist, in continuation
of his artlessly told narrative, remarks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"June 21st, I took my last farewell at Bristol; but when I came to tell
the people, it might be that they would '<em>see my face no more</em>,' high and
low, young and old, burst into such a flood of tears, as I had never seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
before. Multitudes, after sermon, followed me home weeping; and, the
next day, I was employed from seven in the morning till midnight, in
talking and giving spiritual advice to awakened souls.</p>

<p>"About three the next morning, having thrown myself on the bed for an
hour or two, I set out for Gloucester, because I heard that a great
company on horseback, and in coaches, intended to see me out of town.
Some, finding themselves disappointed, followed me thither, where I
stayed a few days, and preached to a very crowded auditory. Then I went
on to Oxford, where we had, as it were, a general rendezvous of the
Methodists; and, finding their interests flourishing, and being impatient
to go abroad, I hastened away, and came to London about the end of
August."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus passed two months more of this strange and eventful
year. Meanwhile, Whitefield had issued his first publication.
The following advertisement appeared in the <cite>Weekly
Miscellany</cite>, July 22, 1737:&mdash;"Speedily will be published
(price sixpence, or two guineas per hundred, to those who
give them away), The Nature and Necessity of our New
Birth in Christ Jesus, in order to Salvation&mdash;a Sermon
preached in the Church of St. Mary's Redcliffe, in Bristol,
by George Whitefield, A.B., of Pembroke College, Oxford.
Published at the request of several of the hearers. Printed
by C. Rivington, in St. Paul's Churchyard; and sold by
Messrs. Harris, Senior and Junior, in Gloucester; Mr. Wilson,
in Bristol; and Mr. Leake, in Bath."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The sermon, thus announced, was published on August
5th, 8vo, 28 pp. The text was, "If any man be in Christ,
he is a new creature." The four divisions were, 1. What is
meant by <em>being in Christ</em>. 2. What we are to understand
by being a <em>new creature</em>. 3. Produce arguments to prove
<em>why</em> we must be <em>new creatures</em> before we can be <em>in Christ</em>.
4. Draw some inferences from the whole. At the present
day, there is nothing in the sermon likely to arrest attention;
but, a hundred and thirty years ago, things were different.
<em>Then</em>, Whitefield's doctrine, if not new, was startling. It
was seldom preached, was hardly understood, and rarely <em>felt</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
As Whitefield himself observes, "though one of the most
fundamental doctrines of our holy religion," "it was so seldom
considered, and so little <em>experimentally</em> understood by the
generality of professors," that when told "they must be born
again, they were ready to cry out, 'How can these things
be?'"</p>

<p>The sermon is not remarkable either for its eloquence or
depth of thought. It is simply plain, earnest, practical.
Two or three extracts, to illustrate Whitefield's style, may be
welcome.</p>

<p>Having propounded the doctrine, that being a <em>new creature</em>
does not mean "a physical change made in us," but rather an
alteration of "the qualities and tempers of our minds," the
preacher proceeds,&mdash;"As it may be said of a piece of gold
that was in the ore, after it has been cleansed, purified, and
polished, that it is a new piece of gold; as it may be said
of a bright glass that has been covered over with filth, when
it is wiped, and so become transparent and clear, that it is a
new glass; or, as it might be said of Naaman, when he recovered
of his leprosy, and his flesh returned unto him like the flesh
of a young child, that he was a new man; so our souls,
though still the same as to essence, yet are so purged, purified,
and cleansed from their natural dross, filth, and leprosy, by
the influences of the Holy Spirit, that they may properly
be said to be <em>made anew</em>!'</p>

<p>One of Whitefield's arguments to prove the necessity of the
new birth was founded on a consideration of the nature of
future happiness. That happiness being <em>spiritual</em>, "unless
our <em>carnal</em> minds are <em>changed</em>, and become <em>spiritualized</em>, we
cannot be made meet to be partakers of it."</p>

<p>"It is true," he says, "we may flatter ourselves, that, supposing
we continue in our natural corrupt estate, and carry
all our lusts along with us, we should notwithstanding relish
heaven, were God to admit us therein. And so we might,
were it a <em>Mahometan paradise</em>, wherein we were to take
our full swing in sensual delights. But since its joys are
only <em>spiritual</em>, and no unclean thing can possibly enter
those blessed mansions, there is an absolute necessity of our
being <em>changed</em>, and undergoing a total <em>renovation</em> of our depraved
natures, before we can have any taste or relish of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
those heavenly pleasures. In the very nature of things,
unless we have dispositions answerable to the objects
that are to entertain us, we can take no manner of complacency
in them. For instance, what delight can the
most harmonious <em>music</em> afford a <em>deaf</em> man; or what
pleasure the most excellent <em>picture</em> give a <em>blind</em> one? Can
a tasteless palate relish the richest dainties? or a filthy
swine be pleased with a garden of flowers? No! And
what reason can be assigned for it? An answer is ready:
Because they have no tempers of mind correspondent
to what they are to be diverted with. And thus it is with
the soul hereafter. For death makes no more alteration in
the soul, than as it enlarges its faculties, and makes it capable
of receiving deeper impressions either of pleasure or pain. If
it delighted to converse with God here, it will be transported
with the sight of His glorious majesty hereafter. If it was
pleased with the communion of saints on earth, it will be
infinitely more so with the communion and society of holy
angels, and of the spirits of just men, made perfect, in heaven.
But, if the opposite of all this be true, it could not be happy,
were God Himself to admit it into the regions of the blessed."</p>

<p>One more extract must suffice. It is taken from the
preface to the sermon, and was hardly adapted to gain the
young preacher favour among the clergy whom it censures.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The importunity of friends, the aspersions of enemies, the great scarcity
of sermons on this subject, among the divines of our own Church, and not
any overweening conceit of the worth of the performance, were, amongst
divers others, the reasons that induced me to permit the publication of
this very plain discourse. If it be made instrumental towards the convicting
of any one sinner, or confirming any one saint, I shall not be solicitous
about the censures that may be passed, either on the simplicity of the
style, or on the youth of the author.</p>

<p>"I hope it will be permitted me to add my hearty wishes, that my
reverend brethren, the ministers of the Church of England, (if such an one
as I may be worthy to call them brethren,) would more frequently entertain
their people with discourses of this nature, than they commonly do;
and that they would not, out of a servile fear of displeasing some particular
persons, fail to declare the <em>whole will</em> of God to their respective
congregations, nor suffer their people to rest satisfied with the shell and
shadow of religion, without acquainting them with the nature and necessity
of that <em>inward holiness and vital purity of heart</em>, which their profession
obliges them to aspire after, and without which no man living can
comfortably see the Lord."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The first sermon which Wesley published, after his conversion,
was on the text, "By grace are ye saved, through faith;"
its <em>principal</em> subject being "salvation, or justification, by faith
only." Whitefield's first sermon is entirely on the new birth.
Both the doctrines are of paramount importance; and the
preaching of the two combined, created, under God, the
Methodism that now exists.</p>

<p>It may be added, that Whitefield's sermon passed through
at least three editions before the year of its publication was
ended.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Other sermons will be mentioned shortly; but, in
the meantime, Whitefield's narrative must be resumed.
Having come to London "about the end of August," expecting
to set sail for Georgia, he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Every hour now seemed a week, and every week a year, till I was
embarked. I knew there was no minister at Frederica, for which place I
was appointed, and I did not care to be absent longer from my proper
charge. Mr. Oglethorpe's going was still retarded, and I had thought it
my duty to go immediately without him, had not he and my other friends
urged that the soldiers would shortly embark, and that I had best go over
with them. This somewhat pacified me; and, having now taken a final
farewell of my friends in the country, I was resolved to abide in London,
and give myself wholly to prayer, the study of the Scriptures, and my own
heart, till the soldiers should embark.</p>

<p>"The house I lodged at was good old Mr. Hutton's,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> in College Street,
Westminster, where I had the pleasure of seeing my dear friend, Mr.
Ingham, lately returned from Georgia; and perceiving him, as I thought,
remarkably grown in grace, I longed still more to be sent to the same
school, hoping to catch some of that holy flame with which his soul was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
fired. We freely and solemnly conversed together about my call abroad;
and it seemed to both quite clear. Our hearts were knit to each other,
like the hearts of David and Jonathan. At midnight, we would rise to sing
praises to God, and to intercede for the whole state of Christ's militant
Church here on earth.</p>

<p>"With this dear friend, I, one day, paid a visit to a worthy doctor of
divinity, near London, who introduced us to some honourable ladies, who
delighted in doing good. It being my constant practice to improve my
acquaintance with the rich for the benefit of the poor, I recommended
two poor clergymen, and another pious person, to their charity. They
said little, but, between them, gave, I think, thirty-six guineas. The
doctor said,' If you had not spoken for others, you would have had a good
deal of that yourself.' God gave me to rejoice that I had nothing, and
the poor all. The next day, upon my return to London, in the first letter
that I opened, was a bank-note of £10, sent from an unexpected hand as
a present to myself.</p>

<p>"About this time, I was prevailed upon to print my sermon on 'The
Nature and Necessity of our New Birth in Christ Jesus,' which, under God,
began the awakening in London, Bristol, Gloucester, and Gloucestershire.
This sermon sold well to persons of all denominations, and was dispersed
very much both at home and abroad. Finding another of my sermons
was printed, without my leave, and in a very incorrect manner, at Bristol,
I was obliged to publish in my own defence; and, afterwards, thought I
had a clear call to print any other discourses, though in themselves mean,
that I found blessed to the good of souls.</p>

<p>"But to return to my public administrations. Being determined to
abide in London till the time of my departure, I followed my usual practice
of reading and praying over the word of God upon my knees. Sweet was
this retirement, but it was not of long continuance. I was invited to preach
at Cripplegate, St. Ann's, and Forster Lane churches, at six on the Lord's-day
morning, and to assist in administering the holy sacrament. I embraced
the invitations, and so many came, that sometimes we were obliged
to consecrate fresh elements two or three times. I also preached at
Wapping Chapel, the Tower, Ludgate, Newgate, and many of the churches
where weekly lectures were kept up. The congregations continually increased,
and generally, on a Lord's-day, I used to preach four times to
very large and very affected auditories, besides reading prayers twice or
thrice, and walking, perhaps, twelve miles in going backwards and forwards
from one church to the other.</p>

<p>"About the latter end of August, finding there were many young men
belonging to the" (Religious) "Societies that attended my administrations,
I entered into one of their singing societies, hoping to have greater opportunities
of doing them good. It answered my design. Our Lord gave
me to spiritualize their singing. After they had taught me the gamut,
they would gladly hear me teach them some of the mysteries of the new
birth. Many sweet nights we spent together in this way; and many of
these youths, afterwards, to all appearance, walked with God.</p>

<p>"About the middle of September, my name was first put into the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
newspapers. The Sunday before, I was prevailed upon to preach a
charity sermon in Wapping Chapel.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The congregation was very large,
and more was collected than had been for many years upon a like occasion.
My friends entreated me to preach another charity sermon, at Sir
George Wheeler's Chapel; and, through the importunity of Mr. Habersham
(since my faithful assistant in the Orphan House), I agreed to do it.
I discoursed upon the widow's giving her two mites. God bowed the hearts
of the hearers as the heart of one man. Almost all, as I was told by the
collectors, offered most willingly. This still drew on fresh applications.
The Sunday following, I preached, in the evening, at St. Swithin's, where
£8 was collected, instead of ten shillings. The next morning, I read in
one of the newspapers, 'that there was a young gentleman going volunteer
to Georgia; that he had preached at St. Swithin's, and collected £8,
instead of ten shillings, £3 of which were in halfpence; and that he was
to preach next Wednesday before the Societies, at their general quarterly
meeting.' This advertisement chagrined me. I immediately sent to the
printer, desiring he would put me in his paper no more. His answer was,
that 'he was paid for doing it, and that he would not lose two shillings
for anybody.' By this means, people's curiosity was stirred up more and
more. On the Wednesday evening, Bow Church, in Cheapside, was
crowded exceedingly. I preached my sermon on 'Early Piety,' and, at
the request of the Societies, printed it.</p>

<p>"Henceforwards, for near three months successively, there was no end
of the people flocking to hear the word of God. The churchwardens and
managers of charity schools were constantly applying to me to preach
for the benefit of the children; and, as I was to embark shortly, they
procured the liberty of the churches on the week-days,&mdash;a thing never
known before. I sometimes had more than a dozen names of different
churches, at which I had promised to preach, upon my slate-book at once;
and, when I preached, constables were obliged to be placed at the door,
to keep the people in order. The sight of the congregations was awful.
One might, as it were, walk upon the people's heads; and thousands went
away from the largest churches for want of room. They were all attention,
and heard like people hearing for eternity.</p>

<p>"I now preached generally nine times a week. The early sacraments
were exceeding awful. At Cripplegate, St. Ann's, and Forster Lane, how
often have we seen Jesus Christ crucified, and evidently set forth before
us! On Sunday mornings, long before day, you might see streets filled
with people going to church, with their lanterns in their hands, and hear
them conversing about the things of God. Other lecture churches near
at hand would be filled with persons who could not come where I was
preaching; and those who did come were like persons struck with pointed
arrows, or mourning for a firstborn child. People gave so liberally to
the charity schools, that this season near,£1000 was collected at the
several churches, besides many private contributions and subscriptions
sent in afterwards. I always preached gratis, and gave myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"The <em>blue-coat</em> boys and girls looked upon me as their great benefactor;
and, I believe, frequently sent up their infant cries on my behalf. Worthy
Mr. Seward, afterwards my dear fellow-traveller, was their hearty friend
and advocate. He was concerned in above twenty charity schools, and,
as I found afterwards, inserted the paragraph that so chagrined me.</p>

<p>"The tide of popularity now began to run very high. In a short time,
I could no longer walk on foot as usual, but was constrained to go in a
coach, from place to place, to avoid the hosannas of the multitude. They
grew quite extravagant in their applauses; and, had it not been for my
compassionate High Priest, popularity would have destroyed me. I used
to plead with Him to take me by the hand, and lead me unhurt through
this fiery furnace. He heard my request, and gave me to see the vanity
of all commendations but His own.</p>

<p>"Not that all spoke well of me. No; as my popularity increased,
opposition increased also. At first, many of the clergy were my hearers
and admirers; but some soon grew angry, and complaints were made
that the churches were so crowded that there was no room for the
parishioners, and that the pews were spoiled. Some called me a spiritual
pickpocket, and others thought I made use of a kind of charm to get the
people's money. A report was spread that the Bishop of London, upon
the complaint of the clergy, intended to <em>silence</em> me. I immediately
waited upon his lordship, and enquired whether any complaint of this
nature had been lodged against me? He answered, 'No.' I asked his
lordship whether any objection could be made against my doctrine?
He said, 'No; for he knew a clergyman who had heard me preach a
plain scriptural sermon.' I asked his lordship whether he would grant
me a license? He said, 'I needed none, since I was going to Georgia.'
I replied, 'Then your lordship will not forbid me?' He gave me a
satisfactory answer, and I took my leave. Soon after this, two clergymen
sent for me, and told me they would not let me preach in their pulpits
any more, unless I renounced that part of my sermon on regeneration,
wherein I wished 'that my brethren would entertain their auditories
oftener with discourses upon the new birth.' This I had no freedom
to do, and so they continued my opposers.</p>

<p>"What, I believe, irritated some of my enemies the more, was my free
conversation with many of the serious Dissenters, who invited me to their
houses, and repeatedly told me 'that, if the doctrine of the new birth
and justification by faith was preached powerfully in the Church, there
would be but few Dissenters in England.' My practice in visiting and
associating with them, I thought, was quite agreeable to the word of God.
Their conversation was savoury, and I imagined the best way to bring
them over was not by bigotry and railing, but by moderation, and love,
and undissembled holiness of life. But these reasons were of no avail.
One minister called me a <em>pragmatical rascal</em>, and vehemently inveighed
against the whole body of Dissenters. This stirred up the people's corruptions;
and, having an overweening fondness for me, whenever they
came to church and found that I did not preach, some of them would go
out again. This spirit I always endeavoured to quell, and made a sermon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
on purpose from these words, 'Take heed how ye hear.' One time, upon
hearing that a churchwarden intended to take £8 a year from his parish
minister, because he refused to let me preach his lecture, I composed a
sermon upon 'Love your enemies,' and delivered it where I knew the
churchwarden would be. It had its desired effect. He came after
sermon, and told me he should not resent the injury the doctor had done
me, and then thanked me for my care.</p>

<p>"Nor was I without opposition from my friends, who were jealous over
me with a godly jealousy. Thousands and thousands came to hear. My
sermons were everywhere called for. News came, from time to time, of
the springing-up and increase of the seed sown in Bristol, Gloucester, and
elsewhere. Large offers were made me, if I would stay in England.
And all the opposition I met with, joined with the consciousness of my
daily infirmities, was but ballast little enough to keep me from oversetting.</p>

<p>"I had a sweet knot of religious friends, with whom I first attempted
to pray <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extempore</i>. Some time, I think in October, we began to set apart
an hour every evening to intercede with the Great Head of the Church to
carry on the work begun, and for the circle of our acquaintance, according
as we knew their circumstances required. I was their mouth unto God,
and He only knows what enlargement I felt in that Divine employ.
Once we spent a whole night in prayer and praise; and many a time, at
midnight and at one in the morning, after I had been wearied almost to
death in preaching, writing, and conversation, and going from place
to place, God imparted new life to my soul, and enabled me to intercede
with Him for an hour and a half and two hours together. The sweetness
of this exercise made me compose my sermon upon <em>Intercession</em>, and I
cannot think it presumption to suppose that partly, at least, in answer to
prayers then put up by His dear children, the Word, for some years past,
has run and been glorified, not only in England, but in many other parts
of the world.</p>

<p>"It was now, I think, that I was prevailed on to sit for my picture.
The occasion was this. Some ill-minded persons had painted me leaning
on a cushion, with a bishop looking very enviously over my shoulder.
At the bottom were six lines, in one of which the bishops were styled
'Mitred Drones.' The same person published in the papers that I had
sat for it. This I looked upon as a snare of the devil to incense the
clergy against me. I consulted friends what to do. They told me I must
sit for my picture in my own defence. At the same time, my aged mother
laid her commands upon me to do so, urging 'that if I would not let her
have the substance, I would leave her at least the shadow.' She also
mentioned the painter, and, meeting with him one night, accidentally, I,
with great reluctance, complied, and endeavoured, whilst the painter was
drawing my face, to employ my time in beseeching the great God, by His
Holy Spirit, to paint His blessed image upon my heart.</p>

<p>"Christmas now drew near. Notice was given me that the soldiers
were almost ready to embark for Georgia, and I resolved to go with them.
The nearer the time of my departure approached, the more affectionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the people grew. At the beginning of Christmas week, I took my leave;
but, oh, what groans and sighs were heard when I said, 'Finally, brethren,
farewell!' At Great St. Helen's, the cry was amazing. I was nearly half
an hour going out to the door. All ranks gave vent to their passions.
Thousands and thousands of prayers were put up for me. They would
run and stop me in the alleys, hug me in their arms, and follow me with
wishful looks. Once in the Christmas before my departure, with many
others, I spent a night in prayer and praise, and, in the morning, helped
to administer the sacrament at St. Dunstan's, as I used to do on Saints'
Days. But such a sacrament I never saw before. The tears of the communicants
mingled with the cup, and had not Jesus comforted our hearts,
our parting would have almost been unsupportable.</p>

<p>"At length, on December 28, I left London and went on board the
<em>Whitaker</em>, after having preached in a good part of the London churches,
collected about £1000 for the charity schools, and got upwards of £300
for the poor of Georgia among my friends."<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This is a strange, almost romantic story. Remembering
Whitefield's youthfulness and the circumstances of his life,
it stands unparalleled. The young Methodist stirred one of
the greatest cities in the world. John Wesley was now on
his way home from Georgia, disappointed, and deplorably
depressed, and wrote, during his ocean journey, "I went to
America to convert the Indians; but, oh, who shall convert
me?" Twelve months before, Charles Wesley began his
"twenty-seventh year in a murmuring, discontented spirit;
reading over and over the third of Job;"<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and during the
interval had been worried with all sorts of Georgian vexations.
Whitefield all the while was almost as happy as a
man could be outside heaven; and, in his pulpit throne, was
wielding a power which moved the hearts of thousands. "I
suppose," said he to his friend Harris, at Gloucester, "you
have heard of my <em>mighty deeds</em>, falsely so called, by reading
the newspapers; but I beseech Mr. Raikes, the printer, never
to put me into his News upon any such account again. All
London is alarmed. Thousands, I hope, are quickened,
strengthened, and confirmed by the word preached. God
still works more and more by my unworthy ministry. Last
week, save one," (November 14, 1737,) "I preached ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
times in different churches; and the last week seven; and
yesterday four times, and read prayers twice. I now begin
to preach charity sermons twice or thrice a week, besides
two or three on Sundays; and sixty or seventy pounds are
collected weekly for the poor children. Thousands would
come in to hear, but cannot." In another letter to the
same friend, dated December 23rd, he writes: "On Wednesday
night, eighteen of us continued all night in praises, and
in praying for you and our other friends. I have preached
above a hundred times since I have been here. Last Sunday,
at six in the morning, when I gave my farewell, the whole
congregation wept and cried aloud. Since that, there is no
end of persons coming and telling me what God has done
for their souls. The time would fail me, were I to relate
how many have been awakened. The great day will discover
all. Meanwhile, pray that the goodness of God may make
me humble. My farewell sermon will be published shortly,
with two or three more."</p>

<p>The charity schools so frequently mentioned in Whitefield's
narrative were schools for the education of the children of
the poor, to a large extent established by the Religious
Societies and by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.
In 1744, there were, in London and Westminster,
136 of these schools, containing 5069 scholars.</p>

<p>Whitefield mentions certain "lecture churches" in which
he preached. These were churches in which the Religious
Societies, founded by Dr. Hornech, Bishop Beveridge, and
others, about the year 1677, commenced six o'clock morning
services every Sunday, at which ministers, specially engaged
for the occasion, preached, and administered the holy communion,
their fees being paid out of the sacramental collections,
and the overplus of such collections being given for
the support of the charity schools just named.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Charles Wesley was in England during the whole of the
year of 1737, but was so occupied with Georgian affairs, and
with other things, that his opportunities of holding communion
with his friend Whitefield were not many. Occasionally,
however, they found time to meet, and rejoiced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
in each other's welfare. Charles writes: "Sunday, October
30th. I waked Jacky Delamotte and Miss Betty at
five, and attended them to Forster Lane, where we heard
Mr. Whitefield, and communicated together." And again:
"Saturday, November 5th. I met and turned back with
Betty to hear Mr. Whitefield preach, not with the persuasive
words of man's wisdom, but with the demonstration of the
Spirit, and with power. The churches will not contain the
multitudes that throng to hear him."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>During the year, Charles had been worried by a young
Dutchman of the name of Appee, who had accompanied;
him from Georgia, a religious hypocrite, who was afterwards
found to be an infidel, a libertine, a liar, and a thief. He
had, also, been introduced to Zinzendorf, just arrived from
Germany, and had promised to call on him every day. At
Zinzendorf's, he had met with Bishop Nitschmann, had
been present at a Moravian service, and had "thought
himself in a choir of angels." The Bishop of Oxford
had received him with the utmost kindness, and had
desired him to call on him as often as he could. He had
visited his old friends at Oxford, and his brother Samuel at
Tiverton. At her desire, he had waited upon Lady Betty
Hastings. He had buried his uncle, Matthew Wesley. He
had met his mother and his sisters. He had greeted his
"old hearty friend, Benjamin Ingham," just returned from
Georgia. He had had interviews with Archbishop Potter,
and with his Majesty George II. He and William Law had
conversed on religious subjects. He had visited the Delamotte
family at Blendon. He had had cavils not a few with
Oglethorpe and the Georgian Trustees. As late as October 14,
he still contemplated a return to Georgia. He preached
occasionally. Everywhere his conversation was religious.
But, compared with his young friend Whitefield, his was a
life of obscurity. He had no preaching popularity, and,
judging from present appearances, was not likely to be
blessed or cursed with so dangerous a thing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Whitefield had burst upon the public
as a blazing comet. His fame was trumpeted throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
London. Even poets began to make him the subject of
their metrical compositions. The following was published
in the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for November, 1737:&mdash;</p>

<p>Whatever may be the merits of this high-flown poem, the
fact that it was inserted in one of the most able and popular
periodicals of the day, affords sufficient evidence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
marvellous fame to which the young Methodist preacher
had attained. The incense, however, was not unmixed.
Whitefield had many friends; but, as was natural, he also
had the fortune of having foes. The crowds praised him;
but already envious critics stealthily derided him. Some of
the clergy murmured discontent. An unknown artist, in his
"Mitred Drones," did his best to make Whitefield ridiculous.
The <cite>Weekly Miscellany</cite>, the principal religious newspaper of
the period, was getting angry, and already commenced that
anti-Methodistic warfare for which it soon became famous.
After a long series of leading articles against infidels, the
editor began, on October 28, another series against enthusiasts.
It is true that Whitefield is not named; but there can be no
doubt that he was the chief person meant. Want of space
prevents the insertion of more than one extract,&mdash;an extract
taken from the first article of the series. The redoubtable
Mr. Hooker writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Enthusiasts <em>feel</em> the truth, though they are unable to defend it; and
if you ask a <em>reason</em>, they can only give you a <em>rapture</em>. <em>Zeal</em> without <em>knowledge</em>,
<em>sound</em> without <em>sense</em>, and a <em>light</em> in themselves <em>which cannot shine
forth before men</em>, are the general symptoms of their disorder. Nay, some
of them make the <em>absence</em> of <em>reason</em> necessary to the <em>presence</em> of the <em>Spirit</em>;
and accordingly their exercises of religion are entirely inconsistent with
the least use of their understanding. Their praying in the Spirit is the
utmost extravagance of passion, the wildest flights of the imagination;
either glaring nonsense, or darkness visible. If in a sermon, for want of
clear thinking or expression, there is room left for the <em>imagination</em> to
<em>bewilder</em> itself; or the preacher gives a loose to his <em>passions</em>, one while
rising with the wildest <em>ecstasy of joy</em>, again sinking into the lowest <em>dejection
of sorrow</em>, and venting sighs of the most immoderate <em>grief</em>; now
railing with all the bitterness of <em>rage</em>, then melting into the most soft and
tender strains of <em>affection</em>; how apt are we, nay, how common is it for the
person himself to believe he is under the influence of the Holy Ghost! His
not being able to govern his <em>own</em> spirit is thought a proof of his having
<em>that</em> of God; as the furor of the Pythian priestess was the sole sign of her
inspiration."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield, however, was not without defenders. In the
year 1733, an important pamphlet was published, with the
following title, "The Oxford Methodists: being an Account
of some Young Gentlemen in that City, in derision so called;
setting forth their Rise and Designs. With some occasional
Remarks on a Letter inserted in Fog's Journal of December 9,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
1732, relating to them. In a Letter from a Gentleman near
Oxford to his Friend in London." On the 9th of December,
1737, a second edition of this pamphlet was issued, "with
very great alterations and improvements," (8vo, 29 pp.) To
this was prefixed a preface of four pages, which, being the
<em>first printed</em><a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> address to Whitefield, deserves to be quoted.
The writer says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This little piece was originally written to vindicate gentlemen called
by the name of Methodists; and, as their conduct has continued ever since
irreproachable, and they have steadfastly persevered in the same course
which so laudably began some years ago, and yet have still the misfortune
to find themselves slightly spoken of by many persons who care not to fall
into their measures, which they may possibly think too strict and self-denying,
it must not be thought improper to reprint it now. And to whom
can it be so fitly addressed as to you, sir, who have passed under that
appellation, and who, by your successful preaching, have so well justified
the conduct of the gentlemen who are the subject of it?</p>

<p>"It must afford no small pleasure to all serious Christians to find, by
your success in the two first cities of the kingdom, that, degenerate as the
age is in which we live, a spirit of piety and attention may nevertheless be
excited in the minds of the generality; and that without any other <em>novelty</em>
than by preaching the <em>plain</em> and <em>obvious</em> doctrines of <em>Christianity</em> in so
<em>serious</em> and <em>affecting</em> a manner as shall show the preacher to be in <em>earnest</em>,
and himself affected by the doctrines he would instil into others. And,
from hence, there is little room to doubt that if the like method was
generally taken by our brethren of the clergy, and if the doctrines of
the <em>Gospel</em> were not made to give way to the only <em>secondary</em> rules of
<em>morality</em>, the like success would attend their labours, and the Christian
religion and our sacred function would be freed from that cold neglect, to
say no worse, which is now too frequently thrown upon both.</p>

<p>"I have heard it rumoured that you have been refused, by some of our
brethren, the use of their pulpits; but, as you have submitted some of your
discourses to the public censure, and as I have not heard it once suggested
by the most invidious that there is anything contained in them in the least
repugnant to the doctrines of Christianity in general, or those of the
Established Church in particular, I hope it cannot be true.</p>

<p>"But be this as it may, let me exhort you, sir, not to be discouraged or
dismayed at any opposition that you may meet with in your good designs;
but preserve (in the midst of the <em>dangerous</em> applauses you meet with from
the crowded audiences that everywhere attend your preaching) that <em>meekness</em>
and <em>humility</em> which must be inseparable from the doctrines you seek
to propagate, and more than any one thing (beside the blessing of God)
insure the success of your labours, and demonstrate to the world that you
are yourself under the happy influences which you seek to spread; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
your actions are regulated by the doctrines you preach; and that God's
glory and the religion of the blessed Jesus are the principal&mdash;the only
motives that animate your conduct and your views.</p>

<p>"This will entitle you to the blessing of God, and the approbation of all
good men; and particularly to the hearty good wishes of your affectionate,
though unknown brother in our common Lord,</p>

<p class="sig">
"A. B."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Another fact in Whitefield's narrative deserves attention,
namely, his Christian intercourse with Dissenters. In this
respect, he was far ahead of his friend Wesley. In Georgia,
Wesley was treating Dissenters with the supercilious tyranny
of a High Church bigot. He refused them the sacrament,
until they first gave up their faith and principles, and, like
Richard Turner and his sons, submitted to be re-baptized by
him.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Respecting John Martin Bolzius, whose beautiful letter
he inserted in his Journal, under the date of September, 1749,
Wesley himself remarks, "What a truly Christian piety and
simplicity breathe in these lines! And yet this very man,
when I was at Savannah, did I refuse to admit to the Lord's
table, because he was not baptized&mdash;that is, not baptized by
a minister who had been episcopally ordained." One of the
accusations against Wesley, handed to the grand jury at
Savannah, was that he "refused the Office of the Dead to
such as did not communicate with him;" and among the
findings of the jury were the following: that he had refused
the sacrament to William Gough, because he had heard
William Gough was a Dissenter; and that he would not
allow William Aglionby to stand godfather to the child of
Henry Marley, because William Aglionby had not been at
the communion table with him.</p>

<p>Such was Wesley in Georgia at the very time when Whitefield
in London was having "free conversation with many of
the serious Dissenters who invited him to their houses."
Who can doubt which of the two Oxford Methodists was
right? Wesley had more learning than Whitefield, but, for
the present, Whitefield had more charity. One had been
bred in Epworth parsonage; the other in a public-house.
One was encrusted with old and almost inherited prejudices
which it was difficult to cast aside; the other had had a training
from which such prejudices were almost, perhaps entirely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
excluded. Wesley, to the day of his death, professed a conscientious
adherence to the Church of England. Whitefield,
almost from first to last, made the Dissenters his friends.</p>

<p>During the year 1737, about half a dozen of Whitefield's
sermons were published; and from these the reader may
obtain a fair idea of the young preacher's sentiments and
style. His almost unbounded popularity is the best excuse
for their being committed to the press. Perhaps neither
time nor study could have ever fitted Whitefield to occupy
the theological professor's chair. He had a calling peculiarly
his own, and well was it fulfilled. He was incapable of
doing the work Wesley did; but there was another kind of
work&mdash;popular, earnest, loving, powerful preaching&mdash;in
which he seems to stand unequalled. His printed sermons
fail to convey a correct conception of his spoken ones. The
preacher's sonorous voice, his intonations, his action,
his facial expressions, are things which could not be
embodied in his published discourses; and yet, to
things like these, the discourses were greatly indebted
for their astonishing effects. Whitefield was the greatest
gospel orator of the age. He never stretched after profundity
of thought. He made no pretensions of excelling
in learned biblical exegesis. A "fine, highly ornamental
style" he appears to have eschewed as much as Wesley
did. He preached simple truth, with all his might; and
witnessed success such as is rarely given a minister to see.
The Wesleys had one kind of mission; Whitefield had
another. The former expounded, enforced, and defended
truth; wrote hymns; published grammars, history, philosophy,
commentaries, and books of almost all sorts and
sizes; organized societies; instituted ministerial synods;
and exercised a kind of episcopal jurisdiction over thousands
of loving and loyal adherents. Whitefield was an <em>evangelist</em>,
a "preacher of the gospel," a man whose chief, if not
only, work was to testify "the truth as it is in Jesus,"
and to convert men "from sin to holiness, and from the
power of Satan unto God." Even the ministerial gifts of
God are manifold; they always have been so; they always
will. At the beginning, "He gave some, apostles; and
some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work
of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ." If
not equally important, all are needed, all are useful, and none
must be despised. "The eye cannot say unto the hand, I
have no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet, I have
no need of you." Such a contempt is an injustice to the
ministers themselves, and a sin against God who gives them.</p>

<p>Rightly to appreciate Whitefield's pulpit power, the
reader of his published sermons must not only ponder <em>what</em>
he said, but make an effort to imagine <em>how</em> he said it. With
such a proviso, let him read the following extracts from
sermons preached and published by the youthful evangelist
in the year 1737, and at the commencement of 1738. One
of these sermons&mdash;on the new birth&mdash;has been already
noticed. Besides this, there were eight others.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>1. "The Nature and Necessity of Society in general, and
of Religious Society in particular. Preached in the Parish
Church of St. Nicholas in Bristol, and before the Religious
Societies, at one of their General Quarterly Meetings in
Bow Church, London, in the year 1737."<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> (8vo, 30 pp.)</p>

<p>In a preface, addressed "to the members of every Religious
Society in and about the Cities of Bristol, London, and
Westminster," Whitefield says, he had not the least intention
to let any other of his "discourses see the light," besides
the one already printed; but some of his "misguided
Bristol friends" had already published "a very incorrect
transcript" of this, and had sold nearly four hundred copies
before he could stop the circulation. The text of the sermon
is Ecclesiastes iv. 9&mdash;12. One short extract must
suffice. Having used various arguments in recommending
Christian fellowship, he proceeds to deduce inferences from
what had been advanced, and says, almost prophetically:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If the advantages of religious society are so many and so great, then
it is the duty of every Christian to establish and promote Societies of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
nature. And I believe we may venture to affirm that, if ever the spirit of
true Christianity is revived in the world, it must be brought about by some
such means as this" (p. 26).</p></blockquote>

<p>When these words were uttered, little did Whitefield
think that the Oxford Methodists would be the means of
forming and establishing such Societies, by thousands, in all
quarters of the globe.</p>

<p>2. "The Almost Christian: A Sermon preached at the
Parish Church of St. John, Wapping. Published at the
desire of the hearers." (8vo, 27 pp.) Text, Acts xxvi. 28.
Two extracts from this sermon may be welcome:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"One reason why so many are only almost Christians is, because they
set out with false notions of religion. Though they live in a Christian
country, they know not what Christianity is. Some place religion in being
of this or that communion; more in morality; most in a round of duties;
and few, very few, acknowledge it to be, what it really is, a thorough
inward change of nature, a divine life, a vital participation of Jesus Christ,
an union of the soul with God. Hence, it happens that so many, even of
the most knowing professors, when you converse with them concerning
the essence, the life, the soul of religion, I mean our new birth in Jesus
Christ, confess themselves quite ignorant of the matter, and cry out with
Nicodemus, How can this thing be?" (p. 12.)</p>

<p>"An almost Christian is one of the most hurtful creatures in the world.
He is a wolf in sheep's clothing. He is one of those false prophets, of
whom our blessed Lord bids us beware, who would persuade men that the
way to heaven is broader than it really is; and, thereby, enter not into
the kingdom of God themselves, and those that are entering in they
hinder. These, these are the men who turn the world into a lukewarm,
Laodicean spirit; who hang out false lights, and so shipwreck unthinking
benighted souls in their voyage to the haven where they would be. These
are they that are greater enemies to the cross of Christ than infidels themselves;
for, of an unbeliever every one will be aware; but an almost
Christian, through his subtle hypocrisy, <em>draws away many after him</em>, and
therefore must expect to <em>receive the greater damnation</em>" (p. 22).</p></blockquote>

<p>This was plain speaking; but who will say that it was not
needed?</p>

<p>The following extract enunciates a doctrine, on which, in
after years, Whitefield and his friend Wesley differed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If pure religion and undefiled consists in the total renewal of our
corrupted natures, then it is not only a work of difficulty, but of time; for,
as the old was not, so neither is the new creation completed in a day.
No; good men know by experience, that it is a long while before old
things can pass away, and all things become new in them. The strong
man armed has gotten too great possession of their hearts to be quickly
driven out, and they are obliged to combat many a weary hour before
their corruptions be wholly taken from them. Nay, they find their whole
lives short enough to perfect the work of regeneration, and never expect
to say, It is finished, till, with their blessed Master, they bow down their
heads, and give up the ghost" (p. 8).</p></blockquote>

<p>This was Whitefield's theology, but not Wesley's.
Whitefield overlooks the all-sufficiency of the Divine Spirit,
and speaks as though human corruptions are to be destroyed
solely by human endeavours. If this assumption were
correct, no one would doubt his doctrine that the <em>entire</em>
sanctification of the soul is impossible previous to the hour
of death. Wesley taught his people to sing&mdash;</p>

preached at the Parish Church of St. Vedast, Foster Lane.
Published at the desire of the hearers." (8vo, 25 pp.) Text,
Joshua xxiv. 15.</p>

<p>One extract will be sufficient to exhibit the young preacher's
earnestness and fidelity:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Fifthly and lastly. If neither <em>gratitude</em> to God, <em>love</em> to your children,
common <em>justice</em> to your servants, nor even that most prevailing motive,
<em>self-interest</em>, will excite; yet let a consideration of the <em>terrors of the Lord</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
persuade you to put in practice the pious resolution in the text. Remember,
the time will come, and that perhaps very shortly, when we must all appear
before the judgment-seat of Christ, where we must give a solemn and strict
account how we have had our conversation, in our respective families, in
this world. How will you endure to see your children and servants (who
ought to be your joy and crown of rejoicing in the day of our Lord Jesus
Christ) coming out as so many swift witnesses against you; cursing the
father that begat them, the womb that bare them, the paps which they
have sucked, and the day they ever entered into your houses? Think you
not, the damnation which men must endure for their own sins will be
sufficient, that they need load themselves with the additional guilt of being
accessory to the damnation of others also? Oh, consider this, all ye that
forget to serve the Lord with your respective households, <em>lest He pluck you
away, and there be none to deliver you</em>" (p. 23).</p></blockquote>

Sermon preached at the Parish Church of St. Andrew,
Holborn, on Sunday, October 9, 1737. Published at the
request of several who heard it." (8vo, 26 pp.) Text, Luke
ix. 23.</p>

<p>The following extract is thoroughly <em>Whitefieldian</em>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thirdly, think often on the pains of hell. Consider whether it is not
better to cut off a right hand or foot, and pluck out a right eye, if they
offend us, or cause us to sin, rather than to be cast into hell, into the fire
that never shall be quenched. Think how many thousands there are now
reserved, with damned spirits, in chains of darkness, unto the judgment of
the great day, for not complying with the precept in the text. And think
withal that this, this must be our own case shortly, unless we are wise in
time, and submit to those easy conditions our Saviour has prescribed us
in order to avoid it. Think you, they now imagine Jesus Christ to be a hard
master; or, rather think you not, they would give ten thousand times ten
thousand worlds, could they but return to life again, and take Christ's
easy yoke upon them? And can <em>we</em> dwell with everlasting burnings more
than <em>they</em>? If we cannot bear this precept, how shall we bear the irrevocable
sentence, 'Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,
prepared for the devil and his angels'?</p>

<p>"Lastly, often meditate on the joys of heaven. Think, think with
what unspeakable glory those happy souls are now encircled, who, when
on earth, were called to deny themselves, and were not disobedient
to the call. Hark! Methinks I hear them chanting their everlasting
hallelujahs, and spending an eternal day in echoing triumphant songs of
joy. And do you not long, my brethren, to join this heavenly choir?
Do not your hearts burn within you? As the hart panteth after the
water-brooks, do not your souls so long after the blessed company of
these sons of God? Behold, then, a heavenly ladder reached down to
you, by which you may climb to this holy hill. If any man will come
after them, let him deny himself, and follow them. By this we, even we,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
may be lifted up into the same blissful regions, there to enjoy an eternal
rest with the people of God, and join with them in singing doxologies and
songs of praise to the everlasting, blessed, all-glorious, most adorable
Trinity, for ever and ever" (p. 26).</p></blockquote>

<p>6. "Of Justification by Christ: A Sermon preached at
the Parish Church of St. Antholin," etc. (8vo, 26 pp.) Text,
"But ye are justified." One extract must suffice. Having
stated that "we all stand in need of being justified, because
we are all chargeable with <em>original sin</em>," Whitefield says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have been, the more particular in treating of this point, because it is
the very foundation of the Christian religion; for I am verily persuaded
that it is nothing but a want of being well grounded in the doctrine of
original sin, and of the helpless, nay, I may say damnable, condition each
of us comes into the world in, that makes so many who call themselves
Christians so very lukewarm in their love to Jesus Christ. It is this, and
I could almost say this only, that makes infidelity abound among us.
We are mistaken if we imagine that men commence or continue infidels,
and set up corrupted reason in opposition to revelation, merely for want
of evidence. No, it is only for want of an humble mind, of a sense of
their original depravity, and an unwillingness to own themselves so
depraved, that makes them so obstinately shut their eyes against the light
of the glorious gospel of Christ. Were they but once pricked to the heart
with a due and lively sense of their natural corruption and liableness to
condemnation, we should have them no more scoffing at Divine revelation,
and looking on it as an idle tale; but they would cry out with
convicted Paul, 'Lord, what wouldest Thou have me to do?' or, with
the trembling jailor, 'Men and brethren, what shall we do to be saved?'"
(p. 10.)</p></blockquote>

<p>7. "The Heinous Sin of Profane Cursing and Swearing:
A Sermon preached at the Parish Church of St. Nicholas,
Cole Abbey"<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> (8vo, 18 pp.) Text, Matthew v. 34. Whitefield's
four divisions are&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I. The crime of profane swearing is highly aggravated, because there
is no temptation in nature to this sin, nor does the commission of it afford
the offender the least pleasure or satisfaction. II. Because it is a sin
which may be so often repeated. III. Because it hardens infidels against
the Christian religion, and must give offence, and occasion much sorrow
and concern, to every true disciple of Jesus Christ. IV. Because it is an
extremity of sin, which can only be matched in hell."</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<p>One of the preacher's inferences is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If these things be so, and the sin of profane swearing is so exceeding
sinful, what shall we say to the unhappy men, who think it not only allowable,
but fashionable and polite, to take the name of God in vain; who
imagine that swearing makes them look big among their companions; and
really think it a piece of honour to abound in it? Alas! little do they
think that such behaviour argues the greatest degeneracy of mind and
foolhardiness. This is what they presume not to do in other cases of less
danger. They dare not revile a general at the head of his army. And
is the Almighty God, the great Jehovah, the everlasting King, who can
consume them with the breath of His nostrils, and frown them into hell in
an instant; is He, I say, the only contemptible being that may be provoked
without fear, and offended without punishment? No. Though
God bear long, He will not bear always. The time will come when God
will vindicate His injured honour, when He will lay bare His almighty
arm, and make those wretches feel the eternal smart of His justice, whose
power and name they have so often vilified and blasphemed. Alas! what
will become of their bravery then? Will they then wantonly sport with
the name of their Maker, and call upon the King of all the earth to damn
them any more in jest? Their note will then be changed. Indeed, they
shall call, but it will be for 'the rocks to fall on them, and the hills to
cover them, from the wrath of Him that sitteth upon the throne, and
from the Lamb for ever.' Time was when they prayed for damnation
both for themselves and others; and now they will find their prayers
answered. 'They delighted in cursing, therefore shall it happen unto
them; they loved not blessing, therefore shall it be far from them; they
clothed themselves with cursing like as with a garment, and it shall come
into their bowels like water, and like oil into their bones'" (p. 16).</p></blockquote>

<p>8. "Intercession every Christian's Duty: A Sermon
preached at the Parish Church of Great St. Helen, on Tuesday,
December 27, 1737. Published at the particular
request of the hearers." (8vo, 26 pp.) Text, "Brethren,
pray for us."</p>

<p>Whitefield was induced to <em>write</em> this sermon by the remarkable
blessings he derived from the intercessory meetings
he commenced in the month of October; and he now <em>preached</em>
it on the day before that on which he left London for
Savannah. It contains one sentiment too startling to be
omitted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To stir you up," cried the young, impassioned preacher, "to stir you
up yet further to this godlike exercise of intercession, consider that, in all
probability, it is the frequent employment even of the glorified saints.
Though they are delivered from the burden of the flesh, and restored to
the glorious liberty of the sons of God, yet, as their happiness cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
perfectly consummated till the resurrection of the last day, when all their
brethren will be glorified with them, we cannot but think they are often
importunate in beseeching our heavenly Father shortly to accomplish the
number of His elect, and to hasten His kingdom. And shall not we, who
are on earth, be often exercised in this Divine employ with the glorious
company of 'the spirits of just men made perfect'?" (p. 18.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The reader will deal with this opinion as he thinks
proper; space will only permit the following further extract
from this first farewell sermon of the great preacher:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You, amongst whom I have now been preaching, in all probability, will
see me no more. I am going from you (I trust under the conduct of
God's most Holy Spirit), knowing not what shall befall me. I need, therefore,
your most importunate intercessions, that nothing may move me
from my duty, and that I may not count even my life dear unto myself,
so that I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry I have received
of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. Whilst I
have been here, to the best of my knowledge, I have not failed to declare
unto you the whole will of God; and, though my preaching may have
been a 'savour of death unto death' to some, yet I trust it has been also
a 'savour of life unto life' to others. The many unmerited kindnesses I
have received from you will not suffer me to forget you. Whilst the
winds and storms are blowing over me, unto the Lord will I make my
supplication for you. In a little while, 'we must all appear before the
judgment seat of Christ,' where I must give a strict account of the doctrine
I have preached, and you of your improvement under it. Oh, may I never
be called as a witness against any of those for whose salvation I have
sincerely, though too faintly, longed and laboured! It is true, I have
been censured by some, as acting from sinister and selfish views; but it
is a small matter with me to be judged by man's judgment. I hope my
eye is single, but I beseech you, brethren, pray that it may be more so,
and that I may increase in the knowledge and love of God through Jesus
Christ our Lord. And now, brethren, what shall I say more? I beseech
you, as my last request, 'Obey them that have the rule over you in the
Lord;' and be always ready to attend on their ministry, as it is your
bounden duty. Think not that I desire to have myself exalted at the
expense of another's character; but rather think this, Not to have any
man's person too much in admiration, but esteem all your ministers highly
in love, as they justly deserve, for their work's sake" (p. 25).</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus ended Whitefield's ministry in London, in the year
1737. The biographer of James Hutton says, "Whitefield
was young and modest, but an earnest preacher. He said
little, however, of justification through the Saviour, but
forcibly insisted on the necessity of being born again. In
this way, he arrested the attention of many, particularly of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the young, and led them to seek the salvation of their souls.
Age 22 They fasted, they wept, and they strove; but how salvation
was to be effected they knew not."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>This is a somewhat startling statement, and yet there is
truth in it. It is an undeniable fact, that, in the nine
sermons already mentioned, there is scarcely a single trace
of the doctrine of justification <em>by faith only</em>. This is one of
the great doctrines of the Word of God. It was pre-eminently
one of the doctrines of Luther and of the Reformation. In
1739, it was the doctrine that created the Methodism that
now exists; but, evidently, it was not as yet a doctrine
Whitefield preached. After all that has been said, it is
difficult to account for this; but, at the same time, it is
impossible to deny it. Whitefield learnt the doctrine soon
afterwards; and, to the end of life, faithfully proclaimed it.</p>

<p>Another point deserves attention. Except, perhaps, the
once uttered opinion that sin cannot be destroyed previous
to the hour of death, there is not the least allusion, in any
of the nine sermons, from which extracts have been given,
to <em>any</em> of the <em>Calvinian</em> doctrines with respect to which
Whitefield afterwards differed from his friend Wesley. These
were dogmas which he had yet to learn. He found them
not in the school of the Oxford Methodists, but among the
Presbyterians and Independents of America.</p>

<p>The quotations from his sermons may seem numerous,
and, to some readers, may be tedious; but, if it be a fact,
as it unquestionably is, that Whitefield is famous <em>chiefly as a
preacher</em>, it is important to be able to form an idea of the
style and spirit of his preaching in this the first year of his
marvellously popular and powerful ministry. It is hoped
that, in this respect, the foregoing extracts will be found
useful. His voice, his intonation, and his pulpit action
cannot be put in type; but the reader may easily ascertain
what were his leading sentiments, and what the fidelity, zeal,
simplicity, and earnestness that marked his preaching.</p>

<p>One more fact must be noticed. James Hutton, the great
Moravian, was Whitefield's publisher, but nearly all the sermons
already mentioned issued from the press of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
distinguished and learned printer of the age, William
Bowyer.</p>

<p>In 1733, John Wesley published "A Collection of Forms of
Prayer for Every Day in the Week." In 1737, James Hutton,
without Wesley's name, and perhaps without Wesley's sanction,
printed a third edition of this manual of devotion, and
advertised it as "recommended by the Rev. George Whitefield,
B.A., of Pembroke College, Oxford." The reason why
Hutton's edition is now named is because it contains Wesley's
preface, which Wesley himself omitted in the edition of his
collected works in 1772, and which it is believed has, with
one exception,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> strangely enough, never been printed since.
The preface is a remarkable production, and, as an exposition
of the principles of Wesley, Whitefield, and their friends, it
is sufficiently important to be transcribed without abridgment.
It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The following Collection of Prayers is designed only for those who, by
the mercy of God, have, first, leisure and resolution to set apart at least half
an hour twice a day for their private addresses to Him; and, secondly, a
sincere reverence for, if not some acquaintance with, the ancient Christian
Church. He who has not the former qualifications will take offence at the
length; he who has not the latter, at the matter of them.</p>

<p>"The intention of the collector was, first, to have forms of prayer for
every day in the week, each of which contained something of deprecation,
petition, thanksgiving, and intercession. Secondly, to have such forms
for those days which the Christian Church has ever judged peculiarly
proper for religious rejoicing, as contained little of deprecation, but were
explicit and large in acts of love and thanksgiving. Thirdly, to have such
for those days which, from the age of the apostles, have been set apart for
religious mourning, as contained little of thanksgiving, but were full and
express in acts of contrition and humiliation. Fourthly, to have intercessions
every day for all those whom our own Church directs us to remember
in our prayers. Fifthly, to comprise in the course of petitions for the
week the whole scheme of our Christian duty.</p>

<p>"Whoever follows the direction of our excellent Church, in the interpretation
of the Holy Scriptures, by keeping close to that sense of them
which the Catholic Fathers and Ancient Bishops have delivered to succeeding
generations, will easily see that the whole system of Christian duty
is reducible to these five heads.</p>

<p>"First, the renouncing ourselves. 'If any man will come after me, let
him renounce himself, and follow me.' This implies, first, a thorough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
conviction that we are not our own; that we are not the proprietors of
ourselves, or anything we enjoy; that we have no right to dispose of our
goods, bodies, souls, or any of the actions or passions of them.' Secondly,
a solemn resolution to act suitably to this conviction; not to live to ourselves,
nor to pursue our own desires; not to please ourselves, nor to suffer
our own will to be any principle of action to us.</p>

<p>"Secondly, such a renunciation of ourselves naturally leads us to the
devoting of ourselves to God; as this implies, first, a thorough conviction
that we are God's; that He is the proprietor of all we are, and all we have;
and that not only by right of creation, but of purchase, for He died for all;
and therefore died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live
unto themselves, but unto Him that died for them. Secondly, a solemn
resolution to act suitably to this conviction; to live unto God; to 'render
unto God the things which are God's,' even all we are, and all we have;
to glorify Him in our bodies, and in our spirits, with all the powers, and
all the strength of each; and to make His will our sole principle of
action.</p>

<p>"Thirdly, self-denial is the immediate consequence of this. For whosoever
has determined to live no longer to the desires of men, but to the
will of God, will soon find that he cannot be true to his purpose, without
denying himself, and taking up his cross daily. He will daily feel some
desire which his one principle of action, the will of God, does not require
him to indulge. In this, therefore, he must either deny himself, or so far
deny the faith. He will daily meet with some means of drawing nearer
to God which are unpleasing to flesh and blood. In these, therefore, he
must either take up his cross, or so far renounce his Master.</p>

<p>"Fourthly, by a constant exercise of self-denial, the true follower of
Christ continually advances in mortification. He is more and more dead
to the world, and the things of the world, till at length he can say, with
that perfect disciple of his Lord,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> 'I desire nothing more but God;' or
with St. Paul, 'I am crucified unto the world; I am dead with Christ; I
live not, but Christ liveth in me.'</p>

<p>"Fifthly, Christ liveth in me. This is the fulfilling of the law, the last
stage of Christian holiness. This maketh the man of God perfect. He,
being dead to the world, is alive to God. The man, the desire of whose
soul is unto His name; who has given Him his whole heart; who delights
in Him, and in nothing else but what tends to Him; who, for His sake,
burns with love to all mankind; who neither thinks, speaks, nor acts, but
to fulfil His will, is on the last round of the ladder to heaven. Grace
hath had its full work upon his soul. The next step he takes is into
glory.</p>

<p>"May the God of glory give unto us who have not already attained this,
neither are already perfect, to do this one thing, forgetting those things
which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,
to press toward this mark for the prize of our high calling in Christ
Jesus!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"May He so enlighten our eyes that we may reckon all things but loss
for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord; and so
stablish our hearts that we may rejoice to suffer the loss of all things, and
count them but dung, that we may win Christ!"</p></blockquote>

<p>In such a frame of mind and heart, young Whitefield went
to Georgia. No wonder that he prospered. Half a dozen
men, animated with the spirit breathing through the foregoing
preface, would at any time move a nation, stir its churches,
and reform its morals. Such men are the gift of God, and
are infinitely more valuable than all the gold in the Church's
coffers. Never did the world need them more than it needs
them now. To have them we must ask for them. "The
harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few; pray ye
therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He would send forth
labourers into His harvest."</p>

<h2><em>FIRST VISIT TO AMERICA.</em></h2>

<h3>1738.</h3>


<p>When Wesley embarked for Georgia, on October 14,
1735, he took with him five hundred and fifty copies
of a treatise on the Lord's Supper, and a few other books,
"the gift of several Christian friends, for the use of the settlers"
in that colony.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> When Whitefield embarked in 1738,
he had a cargo sufficient to excite a smile, and the collection
of which must have cost him considerable thought and
labour.</p>

<p>Besides the £1000 which he collected for the Charity
Schools in London, he also begged, privately among his
friends, £306 3s. "for the poor of Georgia." It will be seen
that this was a large amount, when it is remembered that
money then was four times the value of money now. His
subscription list is notable. Excepting half a guinea from
Stroud, five shillings from Stonehouse, a guinea and a half
from Oxford, and £6 19s. sent by "the Rev. Mr. Thompson,
of Cornwall,"<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> the whole of this amount was given by friends
in Gloucester, Bath, Bristol, and London. Gloucester contributed
upwards of £44, its donors including the Bishop,
£20; the Dean, £1 1s.; six clergymen, upwards of £5;
Robert Raikes, the reputed founder of Sunday-schools, half
a guinea; Lady Selwyn, five guineas; Mr. Harris, jun., Whitefield's
correspondent, a guinea; and "Madame Granville,"
half a guinea.</p>

<p>Bath gave £172 9s. 6d. Of this amount Lady Cox
contributed £50; her sister, Mrs. Bridget Bethel, £100; and
the celebrated Doctor Cheyne a guinea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>London supplied upwards of £40; Bristol, the lowest of
the four cities, £38 10s. 6d., towards which the Dean of
Bristol gave three guineas, and three clergymen, Messrs.
Smith, Taylor, and Probert, four guineas.</p>

<p>Whitefield's items of disbursement are curious. First of
all, there is £50 paid to the trustees of Georgia, "towards
building a church at Frederica." Then there are divers payments
for books, pamphlets, and tracts, including Flavel's
Husbandry, Jenk's Devotion, Norris on Prudence, Wesley's
Forms of Prayer, Law's Call and Perfection, the Bishop of
the Isle of Man's Catechism, Reeve's Apology, 100 sermons
entitled "The Christian Soldier," by Thomas Broughton,
the Oxford Methodist, 150 Common Prayer Books, 25
copies of Watts's Songs, 130 Small Chapmen's books, 50
of Bellamy's Christian Schoolmaster, 50 Spelling Books,
6 Nelson's Festivals, 74 Organist Pocket Companions, 200
Country Parson's Advice, Arndt's True Christianity, etc.,
etc.</p>

<p>The clothing, haberdashery, and other kindred items are
far too numerous to be detailed, but include the following:
stockings for men, women, boys, and girls, at from ten to
fifteen shillings per dozen; shoes for ditto, at from one
shilling and eightpence to three shillings and sixpence per
pair; caps for boys, about sixpence each; three dozen hats
for £2 2s. 6d.; six dozen women's caps, £2 8s. 6d.; twenty-four
striped flannel waistcoats, £2 6s.; twenty-six pairs
of canvas breeches, £1 8s.; to which must be added, payments
for "Holland tapes," "Manchester tapes," "beggars'
tapes," "thread," "cotton laces," "yard-wide cottons," "handkerchiefs,"
and "twelve dozens of shirt buttons."</p>

Husbands, a servant whom the trustees allowed Whitefield to
take from England, £9 7s.</p>

<p>These, perhaps somewhat tedious, extracts from Whitefield's
"Account of Money received and expended, for the
Poor of Georgia," are of some importance. They furnish
the names of some of his warm-hearted friends. They supply
an idea of market prices in 1737. They evince the forethought
and benevolence of the popular preacher, at the
early age of twenty-two. They, also, suggest one reason why
Whitefield was more successful in Georgia than his friend
Wesley. The latter had no friends to purchase gifts for the
motley colonists; the former had more than £300 for this
important purpose. Wesley's ritualism repelled the people;
Whitefield's donatives attracted them.</p>

<p>Wednesday, December 28, 1737, was a notable day in
Whitefield's history. First of all, he and his friends had a prayer
meeting at the house of Hutton, the Moravian. Then they
received the holy sacrament at the Church of St. Dunstan, Fleet
Street, close to James Hutton's place of business. After that,
another meeting for united prayer was held at the house of
Hutton's father in Westminster. In the evening, amid cold
wintry darkness, Whitefield left London for Savannah, and,
accompanied by four of his faithful friends, arrived at Deptford
at ten o'clock. The excitement of the day was not ended
even now. Many of his admirers had preceded him on foot,
and here, in the house of "a widow woman," from two to
three hours more were spent, in singing "psalms and hymns
and spiritual songs," and in making intercession for their
"friends and enemies and all mankind." It was not, however,
until five weeks after this that Whitefield sailed from the
English coast, and a brief account of the way in which
this interval was passed must be inserted. With a heart full
of the love of Christ, such a man could not be idle. He must
be about his Master's business.</p>

<p>Without entering into details respecting Georgia, it may
be shortly stated that, at this particular time, the colony was
exceedingly unsettled. On Oglethorpe's return, he reported,
to a special meeting of the trustees, held January 19, 1737,
that "the people on the frontiers suffered under constant
apprehension of invasion, as the insolent demands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
threats of the Spanish Commissioner from Cuba virtually
amounted to an infraction of the treaty which had been
formed with the governor of Florida." Because of this,
Oglethorpe urged upon the trustees the necessity of applying
to His Majesty for a military force adequate to the defence
of Georgia and South Carolina. A petition was presented.
The request was granted; and, in the month of June following,
the king appointed Oglethorpe general of all his forces
in Carolina as well as in Georgia, and likewise commissioned
him to raise a regiment. As, however, it was deemed
expedient to reinforce Georgia before Oglethorpe's regiment
was complete,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> a small body of troops was sent from England,
with as little delay as possible, and others were
forwarded from Gibraltar.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Whitefield had been presented to
the living of Savannah, and had long been eager to be
among his parishioners. The embarkation of the troops
offered an opportunity; and hence, accompanied by his
servant, Joseph Husbands, and his friend and fellow-traveller,
James Habersham,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> he now started to his distant destination,
acting as chaplain to the troops, until his arrival among the
colonists who had been committed to his care.</p>

<p>A day was spent at Deptford, most of it in prayer and in
"chanting and singing psalms," while at night he preached
for the first time without the use of notes.</p>

<p>On December 30th, he went on board the <em>Whitaker</em>, at
Purfleet, and on the day following began his ministerial
services by having public prayers on open deck. After
prayers, he preached from the words, "I am determined to
know nothing among you save Jesus, Christ and Him crucified."
At noon, he went on shore, and, with his London
friends, "spent two or three delightful hours in praising and
blessing God." While there, a deputation from the clergyman
at Gravesend came, requesting him to preach in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Gravesend Church; and he heartily complied. Thus was
spent the last day of the eventful year 1737.</p>

<p>Next morning, he and his friends rose early, retired to an
adjacent hill, and began the year 1738 by holding a prayer
meeting in the open air. This, being ended, he was agreeably
surprised with the coming of another group of his
metropolitan admirers, who had been sailing down the
Thames the whole of the winter's night purposely to see
him. At ten, they all went to church, Whitefield preached,
and the curate, at their request, administered to them the
holy sacrament. In the afternoon, he "preached again to a
more numerous congregation than in the morning." He
adds, "I was pressed to preach a third time at six in the
evening. This was a thing entirely new; but, upon the
curate's readily complying to lend the pulpit, I looked upon
it as a call of Providence, and accordingly read prayers
and preached to a crowded auditory; and this I did
without notes, having brought but two written sermons
with me."</p>

<p>Five days more were spent in the vicinity of Gravesend
before the ship set sail; but every day Whitefield went
on board and performed his ministerial duties. His
floating flock, "exclusive of the ship's company," consisted
of above a hundred souls. "The ship," writes Dr. Gillies,
"was full of soldiers, and there were near twenty women
among them. The captains, both of the soldiers and sailors,
with a surgeon and a young cadet, soon gave him to understand
that they looked upon him as an impostor, and for a
while treated him as such. The first Lord's-day, one of
them played on the hautboy, and nothing was to be seen
but cards, and little heard but cursing and blasphemy. He
began mildly and gently to reprove the officers in the cabin,
but this had little effect. 'I could,' he writes, 'do no more
for a season than, whilst I was writing, now and then turn
my head, by way of reproof, to a lieutenant of the soldiers,
who swore as though he was born of a swearing constitution.
Now and then he would take the hint, return my nod with,
"Doctor, I ask your pardon," and then to his cards and
swearing again.'"</p>

<p>On shore at Gravesend, Whitefield greatly enjoyed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
society of his London friends, who refused to leave him
until the vessel started. They conversed, they prayed, and
sung psalms together. Among others, Charles Wesley paid
him a flying visit.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> He writes, "We prayed, sung psalms,
commended one another to God, and parted the next morning
like Christian brethren."</p>

<p>At length, on January 6, the ship set sail from Gravesend.
"God," says Whitefield, "gave me great comfort, and I went
between decks, and sat down on the floor, and read Arndt's
'True Christianity.' Part of the time, I stood on deck, and
admired the wonders of God in the deep. I read prayers
and preached near the stern, having no place for retirement;
talked to the sailors on the forecastle; wrote my journal;
and climbed up into my cabin bed, where my friend Habersham
and I lay as comfortably as on a bed of state."</p>

<p>The ship was detained two days at the Nore, during which
the officers began to look upon the young evangelist more
favourably, and the captain offered him the use of his own
cabin as a place of privacy.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> On January 9, the ship
anchored before Margate. Whitefield went on shore and
visited the curate, with whom he conversed on the necessity
of preaching the new birth, and the benefit of visiting from
house to house. He also gave him Law's "Serious Call,"
and "Christian Perfection," and other kindred books. Here,
likewise, he wrote "to Mr. H." (probably James Hutton, the
Moravian) a letter full of catholicity, zeal, and faith, from
which the following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Margate</span>, <em>January 9, 1738</em>.
</p>

<p>"Hither the good providence of God has safely brought us. Our ship
cast anchor near this town, and my dear fellow-traveller and I came on
shore to buy some things we wanted. We have been most courteously
treated by the curate of the place, and had some Christian conversation.
The winds and storms are blustering about our ears, and teaching us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
lessons of obedience to Him whom winds and seas obey. Divine goodness
attends us wherever we go. Oh, dear sir! who would not leave their few
ragged, tattered nets to follow Jesus Christ? The favours I have received
from you, and others of your Christian brethren, will never go out of my
mind, though you differ from me in some outward modes. I would willingly
be of so catholic a spirit as to love the image of my Divine Master
wherever I see it. I am far from thinking God's grace is confined to any
set of men whatever. No. I know the partition wall is now broken down,
and that Jesus Christ came to redeem people out of all nations and languages
and tongues; and therefore His benefits are not to be confined to
this or that particular set of professors.</p>

<p>"You know, sir, upon what a design I am going, and what a stripling
I am for so great a work; but I stand forth as David against Goliath in
the name of the Lord of hosts. God give me a deep humility, a well-guided
zeal, a burning love, and a single eye; and, then let men or devils
do their worst."</p></blockquote>

<p>On January 11, they again set sail, and came to Deal,
where there was another detention of three weeks' continuance.
Besides attending to his ministerial duties on board, Whitefield
every day went on shore. At the first visit to the town,
he and Habersham were so delighted with the scenery, that
they "expressed their thankfulness in singing psalms all the
way." His occupations, both on sea and land, were multifarious.
He finished his expositions of the Apostles' Creed.
He wrote letters. He taught Latin to his friend Habersham.
He tried to save a soldier from punishment, who had been
"tied neck and heels" for mutiny. When he entered the
ship three weeks ago, he united four couples in the bond of
marriage; but already one of the men, a soldier, was tired of
his newly-acquired wife, and wanted to be rid of her. He
was reminded of his marriage vow, and "he immediately
took to her again." Whitefield commenced expounding
the Church Catechism. He visited the <em>Amy</em> and the <em>Lightfoot</em>,
two accompanying transport ships, also conveying troops
to the transatlantic colonies. He preached in the house of
his landlady on shore, and the people came in such numbers,
that the poor woman feared "the floor would break
under them." "All Deal," said Whitefield, "seems to be in
a holy flame." A Baptist "teacher" came to discourse with
him. He thought the Baptist "was a spiritual man;" but
"asked him several questions about taking the ministerial
function, without being called as was Aaron." Whitefield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
writes: "He did not answer to my satisfaction; but we both
agreed in this, that unless 'a man be born again, he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God.'" Several of Whitefield's
London friends, hearing of his detention, came to Deal to
visit him, and many a happy hour was spent with them in
Christian conversation, in prayer, and in singing Psalms.
On Sunday, January 29, after his usual service in the ship, he
"returned on shore, and, accompanied with a troop of pious
friends, hastened to a church about a mile and a half from
Deal," where he "preached to a weeping, thronged congregation,
at the request of the minister." In the afternoon,
he preached at Upper Deal, and writes: "The church was
quite crowded, and many went away for want of room;
some stood on the leads of the church outside, and looked
in at the top windows, and all seemed eager to hear the
word of God. In the evening, such numbers came to hear
that I was obliged to divide them into four companies, and
God enabled me to expound from six till ten."</p>

<p>Next morning, he preached again in the church at
Upper Deal, to a crowded audience. Soon after the service
ended, the wind changed, and a cry came, "Prepare yourselves
for sailing." Whitefield hastened to the shore, the
people "running in droves after him." "The sea was
boisterous, and the waves rose mountains high;" but, in
their boat, Whitefield and Habersham "went on singing
psalms and praising God, the waters dashing in their faces
all the way."</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, that two days after this, while
the ship <em>Whitaker</em> was still at anchor, Wesley, at half-past
four o'clock in the morning, landed at Deal, on his return
from Georgia. Great was his surprise to hear that Whitefield
was close at hand; and, still smarting from the wrongs
he had suffered at Savannah, he immediately despatched a
letter advising the young evangelist to relinquish his mission.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
Whitefield's answer, written on board the <em>Whitaker</em>, was as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Downs</span>, <em>February 1, 1738</em>.
</p>

<p>"I received the news of your arrival (blessed be God!) with the utmost
composure, and sent a servant immediately on shore to wait on you, but
found that you were gone. Since that, your kind letter has reached me.
But I think many reasons may be urged against my coming to London.
For, first, I cannot be hid if I come there; and the enemies of the Lord
will think I am turning back, and so blaspheme that holy name wherewith
I am called. Secondly, I cannot leave the flock committed to my
care on shipboard, and perhaps while I am at London the ship may sail.
Thirdly, I see no cause for not going forwards to Georgia. Your coming
rather confirms (as far as I can see) than disannuls my call. It is not fit
the colony should be left without a shepherd. And though they are a stiff-necked
and rebellious people, yet as God hath given me the affections of
all where I have been, why should I despair of finding His presence in a
foreign land?"<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield's answer was worthy of himself. Who can
estimate what would have been the consequences of Whitefield's
yielding to Wesley's wish? Had he now returned
to London, the probability is he would never again have
started for America; and, in such a case, many of the
brightest chapters of his history could never have been
penned. Wesley's advice was natural; but Whitefield's
reply was right. Had Wesley known all that had transpired,
he would not have given the counsel that he did. Whitefield's
services in Georgia were engaged by the Georgian
Trustees. He was the bearer of a large number of useful
presents, purchased by the money of his friends for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Georgian colonists. He was the recognised chaplain of a
ship conveying troops sent for the defence of those distant
emigrants. If Whitefield had relinquished his mission, he
would have justly inherited indelible disgrace.</p>

<p>On the day after the letter to Wesley was written, the
long-detained ship again set sail, and on February 19th
arrived at Gibraltar. As usual, Whitefield read prayers,
and preached to the soldiers daily. He explained the
Catechism to the women, and exhorted them particularly to
be obedient to their husbands, "which they had lately been
wanting in." At the request of Captain Whiting, he began
"to have full public prayers," and to expound the lessons to
the officers in the "great cabin." On Wednesday, February
8th, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Had public worship and expounded, as usual, to both my congregations.
In the afternoon, I preached and read prayers on open deck, at the
captain's desire, who ordered chairs to be brought, and boards put across
them for the soldiers to sit upon. My subject was <em>The Eternity of Hell
Torments</em>, and I was earnest in delivering it, being desirous that none of
my dear hearers should experience them."</p></blockquote>

<p>This was a fearful topic, in such a place, and before such
a congregation; and great must have been the young
preacher's courage in selecting it. The sermon was published
in the year following, and the ensuing extracts will
serve to exhibit Whitefield's boldness in uttering, face to
face, sentiments so terrible, to the men and officers with
whom he was so closely associated in his floating church.</p>

<p>Having proved his doctrine from Scripture, and answered
several objections, Whitefield proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Knowest thou, O worm, what blasphemy thou art guilty of in charging
God with injustice? Shall the thing formed say to Him that formed it,
Why hast thou made me thus? Wilt thou presume to arraign the
Almighty at the bar of thy shallow reason? Hath God said it, and shall
He not do it? He hath said it, and let God be true, though every man
be a liar. Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? Assuredly He
will. And if sinners will not own His justice in His threatenings here,
they will be compelled, ere long, to own and feel them when tormented
by Him hereafter. Would we now and then meditate a while by faith on
the miseries of the damned, I doubt not we should hear many an unhappy
soul venting his fruitless sorrows in some such piteous moans as these:
'O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
death! O foolish mortal that I was, thus to bring myself into these never-ceasing
tortures for the transitory enjoyment of a few short-lived pleasures,
which scarcely afforded me any satisfaction, even when I most indulged
myself in them! Alas! are these the wages, the effects of sin? Are all
the grand deceiver's promises come to this? O damned apostate! First
to delude me with pretended promises of happiness, and, after years of
drudgery in his service, thus to involve me in eternal woe! Oh that I had
never hearkened to his beguiling insinuations! Oh that I had taken up
my cross and followed Christ! Oh that I had never ridiculed serious
godliness, and condemned the truly pious as too severe, enthusiastic, or
superstitious! Alas! these reflections come too late. I have in effect
denied the Lord that bought me, and therefore justly am I now denied by
Him. But must I live for ever tormented in these flames? Must my
body, which not long since lay in state, was clothed in purple and fine
linen, and fared sumptuously every day&mdash;must this be here eternally confined
and made the mockery of insulting devils? Oh, eternity! That
thought fills me with despair&mdash;I <em>cannot, will not</em>, yet <em>I must be</em> miserable
for ever!'</p>

<p>"But I can no more. These thoughts are too melancholy for me
to dwell upon, as well as for you to hear; and God knows, as punishing is
His strange work, so denouncing His threatenings is mine. But if the
bare mentioning the torments of the damned is so shocking&mdash;good God!
terrible must the enduring of them be!"</p></blockquote>

<p>A sermon in such a strain would give offence in many of
the costly churches and pretentious chapels of the present
day; but it was devoutly listened to on board the <em>Whitaker</em>.
Why? Perhaps, one reason may be found in the solemn
fact that it is the sovereign prerogative of God, not only to
raise up faithful preachers, but, to give ears to hear, and
hearts to understand.</p>

<p>For more than a fortnight, Whitefield was detained at
Gibraltar, where he received the greatest kindness. Major
Sinclair, a gentleman whom he had never seen before, hearing
of his arrival, provided him two handsome rooms in a
merchant's house,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and ministered to his wants. General
Columbine and many others treated him with the utmost
courtesy. Governor Sabine gave him a general invitation
to dine with him every day during his stay, an invitation
which was frequently accepted. The governor was an
exemplary man, and, except when prevented by ill-health,
had not been absent from public prayers for seven years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
His table was sumptuous; but his guests, officers and
others, indulged in no excesses. "We had," says Whitefield,
the once Oxford ascetic, "what an Epicurean would
call <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">c&oelig;na dubia</i>; but the law at the governor's table was
the same with that of Ahasuerus, 'No one was compelled;'
and all the officers behaved in such a decent manner every
time I dined there, that they pleased me very much."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>2. T. Cooper, "at the Globe in Paternoster Row," saw it, and printed it,
without the writer's knowledge or consent. 3. James Hutton, himself a
publisher, was wroth&mdash;denounced Cooper's edition as surreptitious, and
said the Journal was sent to him (Hutton) to be communicated to Whitefield's
friends; "but not to be made public without the advice and correction
of certain persons particularly known to himself." 4. Hutton added
that, "Whitefield knew himself too well to obtrude his little private concerns
upon the world&mdash;especially when intermixed with such passages
relating to others as none but an unthinking person could judge proper
to divulge." 5. Nevertheless, Mr. Cooper having published his surreptitious
copy, he (Hutton) "at the earnest solicitation of several of Mr.
Whitefield's friends, now determined to print the whole." 6. T. Cooper
resented this, and, in the <cite>Weekly Miscellany</cite> for August 11, 1738, there
was an advertisement of Cooper's edition with the following postscript:
"Notwithstanding the clamour that has been made about this copy being
surreptitious, I can, with the utmost veracity, assure the public that it is
genuine to a great degree of exactness; and the advertiser against it
is desired to point out, for the notice of the public, any <em>passage</em>, <em>circumstance</em>,
or even <em>any word</em>, that has been altered, or which varies from the
copy which (he says) he has in his hand, and which he has owned he
never designed to have published.&mdash;T. C."</p>

<p>It may be added that Hutton's publication went through four editions
in 1738. It was issued in 12mo., pp. 70.]</p>

<p>Whitefield often went on board the <em>Whitaker</em>, where he
read prayers, and expounded to his military flock. Such,
however, had been the result of his labours among them,
that, when he was detained on shore, the soldiers had
meetings of their own, and read prayers and sang psalms by
themselves. The Protestant ministers of Gibraltar received
the youthful missionary with the greatest kindness; and, in
compliance with their request, and that of the governor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
he preached several times in their churches. He writes:
"I was asked by Dr. C., in the name of the governor, to
preach every Prayer Day whilst I stayed at Gibraltar, which
I promised to do." In accordance with this, there are the
following entries in his Journal:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Feb. 26. Preached in the morning at Gibraltar, before such a congregation
of officers and soldiers as I never before saw. The church,
though very large, was quite thronged; and God was pleased to shew me
that He had given extraordinary success to my sermon.</p>

<p>"March 1. Preached, according to my promise, to a numerous and
affected audience of officers, soldiers, etc.</p>

<p>"March 3. About ten, I preached my sermon against <em>Swearing</em>, and
made a farewell application to the soldiers who were going to Georgia
out of the garrison. The governor had that morning reviewed them;
and, as I could not be in the same ship with them, I desired that they
might be ordered to come to church, that I might have an opportunity of
telling them how to behave in that land which they were going to protect.
The colonel and governor most readily consented; there was a most
thronged audience, and God was pleased to set His seal to my sermon.
Many officers and soldiers wept sorely, and a visible alteration was
observed in the garrison for some days after.</p>

<p>"March 5. Went to the church belonging to the garrison; preached
to a most thronged audience, and received (what my soul longed after)
the sacrament of Christ's most blessed body and blood. Both the generals
were there, and near fifty communicants. The weekly collection for
the poor was larger than was ever known; and &mdash;&mdash; was so affected,
that he wished himself a despised Methodist. Dined at Governor Sabine's,
and, at the request of the inhabitants and gentlemen of the garrison,
preached again in the afternoon."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such extracts are full of interest. The young Methodist
chaplain of the Oxford prisoners was now, by request,
preaching, with power and success, to crowded military
congregations, assembled in the strongest fortress in the
world.</p>

<p>These public sermons, however, were but a small part of
Whitefield's efforts to benefit and bless the Gibraltar population.
Six days after his arrival, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Saturday, Feb. 25. About six this morning, I went with friend
Habersham to the church to pray with some devout soldiers, who I heard
used to meet there at that time, and with whom my soul was knit immediately.
After we had finished our devotion, I found that their Society
had been subsisting about twelve years, and that Sergeant B., now amongst
them, was the beginner of it. At first, they used to meet in dens, and
mountains, and caves in the rocks; but, afterwards, upon their applying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
for leave to build a little place to retire in, Dr. C. and Governor
Sabine gave them the free use of the church, where they constantly
met three times a day to pray, read, and sing psalms, and at any other
season when they pleased. They have met with contempt, and are now,
in derision, called 'The New Lights.' A glorious light they are indeed;
for I conversed closely with several of them, and they made me quite
ashamed of my little proficiency in the school of Christ. Governor Sabine
countenances them much, and has spoken of them to me with respect."</p></blockquote>

<p>The circumstances which gave birth to this Society of
praying soldiers are now unknown; but the existence of
such a Society, and its unpretentious meetings, are facts of
no ordinary interest and importance. God is not confined
to pulpits to carry on His work. In all ages there have
been devout fraternities, not recognised by men, but cheered
by His countenance and blessing. When Elijah thought
himself the only one "faithful among the faithless," God
had seven thousand left in Israel who had not bowed the
knee to Baal. Who, except God Himself, can tell the
number of pious brotherhoods now existing in India, China,
Japan, and all the world over, bearing a resemblance to the
Society of "New Lights," with whom Whitefield so strangely
met at the Rock of Gibraltar?</p>

<p>The "New Lights," indeed, were not the only Society of
a religious kind in this famous garrison. These were evidently
members of the Church of England; but there was
another coterie, called, with equal derisiveness, "Dark Lanthorns,"
who belonged to the Church of Scotland. Whitefield
"did not think it agreeable to visit these." Even in
his eyes, they were a sort of tabooed Dissenters, with whom
it would not be orthodox to mingle; but he "sent them
some proper books, had religious talk with several of them,
and endeavoured to unite both Societies together."</p>

<p>His relationship with the Episcopal "New Lights" was
altogether different. During the nine days after he became
acquainted with them, he met them every morning, to pray,
to sing psalms, and to expound the daily Lessons. Some
of the soldiers often came as early as two o'clock. Pure
and precious were these morning meetings. No wonder
that Whitefield's ardent "soul was knit" to such early
worshippers; and no wonder that, having joined with them
in their matin songs, he should also regularly unite in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
vesper devotions. The numbers attending, especially at
nights, grew into large congregations, including "officers,
and honourable women not a few." On Thursday night,
March 2, there were above three hundred present; "among
whom were many officers, ladies, and Dr. C., the minister of
the church himself," who wanted Whitefield, instead of praying
and expounding on the floor, to mount the reading desk,
where he could be better seen. The next evening, his congregation
consisted of above five hundred; and the next
after that, of about a thousand. On the last Sunday he
spent at Gibraltar, at five o'clock, he had his "morning
exposition in the church;" after that, he "went and saw
the Roman Catholics at their high mass," and thought there
"needed no other argument against Popery than to see the
pageantry, superstition, and idolatry of their worship;" at
ten, he preached in the church belonging to the garrison,
and received the sacrament; in the afternoon, in the same
place, he preached again; and "expounded in the evening
to above a thousand hearers of all denominations; and went
home full of unspeakable comfort," and remarking, "I am
never better than when I am on the full stretch for God."</p>

<p>Next morning&mdash;his last at Gibraltar&mdash;many came to him
weeping, telling him what God had done for their souls, and
desiring his prayers. Others gave and sent him tokens of
their love, as cakes, figs, wine, eggs, and other necessaries
for his voyage. Nearly two hundred soldiers, women, and
officers accompanied him to the seaside, sorrowing at his
departure, and wishing him good luck in the name of the
Lord. He was gladly received on board the <em>Whitaker</em>, and
at once resumed his duties.</p>

<p>This was a strange episode in the life of the young
evangelist. Like his Divine Redeemer, he "increased in
favour with God and man." His heart was full of gratitude.
In a letter, dated Gibraltar, February 25, 1738," he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"God has been with us of a truth. He has led us through the sea, as
through a wilderness, and brought us to a haven, where I am honoured
with many honours. About six o'clock this morning, I went to the church,
where was assembled a number of decent soldiers, praying, and singing
psalms to Christ as God. They meet constantly three times a day, and I
intend henceforward to meet with them. They pray without ceasing,
have overcome the world, hate sin, love their enemies and one another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Oh, who would not travel to see how the Spirit of God is moving poor
sinners' souls up and down the world! God, I find, has a people everywhere;
Christ has a flock, though but a little one, in all places. God be
praised that we are of this flock, and that it will be our Father's good
pleasure to give us the kingdom."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 7th of March, the <em>Whitaker</em> set sail for Savannah,
and, on Sunday, the 7th of May, cast anchor near Tybee
Island. During this two months' voyage, the duties of
Whitefield's chaplaincy were performed with his usual regularity
and zeal. He finished his exposition of the Creed,
and then began to expound the Decalogue. Habersham
taught the children; and several of the soldiers began
learning to read and write. Occasionally, Whitefield visited
the <em>Lightfoot</em> and the <em>Amy</em>, two accompanying ships, dined
with the officers, dispersed Bibles, Testaments, and Soldiers'
Monitors among the men, and, on one occasion, threw overboard
their cards. On board the <em>Amy</em>, he preached to above
two hundred and twenty hearers; and says, "I married a
couple, who did not behave so well as I could wish. The
bridegroom laughed several times in the midst, of the solemnity,
upon which I shut up my Prayer-book. He began to
weep, and I then proceeded, and gave him and the bride a
Bible, as the best present I could make them."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>On board both the <em>Whitaker</em> and <em>Lightfoot</em>, he preached
his sermon against <em>Drunkenness</em>, which was published, as soon
as he returned to England, and from which the following
extracts are taken. The text was Ephesians v. 6; and
the divisions were,&mdash;Drunkenness is a heinous sin, because,
1. It is an abuse of God's creatures. 2. By it a man sinneth
against his own body. 3. It robs a man of his reason. 4. It
is an inlet to, and a forerunner of, many other sins. 5. It
separates the Holy Spirit from us. 6. It absolutely unfits a
man for the enjoyment of God in heaven, and exposes him
to His eternal wrath.</p>

<p>The reader may easily imagine that, under such divisions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the bold and ardent preacher would find employment for
strong and scathing language.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Flee drunkenness!" he cried, "flee drunkenness, since he that committeth
that crime, sinneth against his own body. Who hath pains in
the head? Who hath rottenness in the bones? Who hath redness of
eyes? He that tarries long at the wine; he that rises early to seek new
wine. How many walking skeletons have you seen, whose bodies were
once exceeding fair to look upon; but, by this sin of drinking, how has
their beauty departed from them, as though God intended to set them up,
as He did Lot's wife, for monuments of His justice?</p>

<p>"Think ye, O ye drunkards, that you shall be partakers of the inheritance
of the saints in light? No: as by drunkenness you have made your
hearts cages of unclean birds, with unclean spirits must you dwell. A
burning <em>Tophet</em>, kindled by God's wrath, is prepared for your reception,
where you must suffer the vengeance of an eternal fire, and in vain cry
out for a drop of water to cool your tongues. Indeed, you shall drink, but
it shall be the cup of God's fury. I call heaven and earth to witness
against you this day, that, as surely as the Lord rained fire and brimstone
upon Sodom, so surely will He cast you into a lake of fire and brimstone,
when He shall come to take vengeance on them that know not God, and
have not obeyed the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. Behold, I have
told you before. Remember you were this day informed what the end
of drunkenness would be. And I summon you, in the name of that
God whom I serve, to meet me at the judgment-seat of Christ, that you
may acquit both my Master and me; and confess, with your own mouths,
that your damnation was of yourselves, and that we were freed from the
blood of you all."</p></blockquote>

<p>This was hard hitting, and yet Whitefield seemed to make
no enemies, but, by his fidelity, increased the number of his
friends. "Colonel Cochrane was extremely civil; and such
was the change upon Captain Mackay, that he desired
Whitefield not to give himself the trouble of expounding
and praying in the cabin and between decks; for he would
order a drum to be beat morning and evening, and himself
would attend with the soldiers on deck." Henceforward,
Whitefield preached with a captain on each side of him, and
soldiers round about him; the two other ships' companies
often drawing near, and joining in the worship of the great
Creator. Once, after the public sermon, Captain Mackay
desired the soldiers to stop, whilst he informed them that, to
his great shame, he had been a notorious swearer, but, by
the instrumentality of that gentleman, pointing to Whitefield,
he had abandoned the sin, and wished them all to copy his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
example.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> After the sermon on drunkenness, also, the
captain seconded the effort of the chaplain, and "exhorted
the men to give good heed to the things that had been
spoken." A fever breaking out, Whitefield, "for many days
and nights, visited between twenty and thirty sick persons,
crawling between decks upon his knees, administering medicines
and cordials," and giving suitable advice. The result
of the whole was a marvellous reformation. One of the
sailors, who had been a notorious scoffer, sent for Whitefield
in bitter agony, and loudly lamented his past wickedness.
The cadet, who had received a university education, and
who, the first Sunday after sailing from the Thames, amused
himself and others by playing on the hautboy, told Whitefield
the history of his life, and expressed his intention to devote
himself to the service of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Concerning the
soldiers, Whitefield says: "I have no reason to complain
of them, for they come very regularly twice a day to prayer,
and an oath seems to be a strange thing amongst most of
them. Many marks of a sound conversion appear in several
aboard, and we live in perfect harmony and peace, loving
and beloved of one another. In the great cabin, we talk of
little else but God and Christ."</p>

<p>The voyage was long, and not without its incidents, in
some of which Whitefield himself was prominent. For
instance, the captain's negro servant died, was wrapped in a
hammock, and thrown into the sea; but, because the poor
creature was not baptized, Whitefield was Churchman enough
to say, "I could not read the office over him." On the other
hand, a baptized soldier "killed himself by drinking," and
Whitefield writes: "I buried him in time of public prayers,
chose proper lessons, and gave the soldiers a suitable
exhortation." A little boy, four years old, refused to repeat
the Lord's Prayer. The young clergyman forced him upon
his knees, and gave him "several blows." The urchin then
went through the Prayer, and Whitefield rewarded him with
figs. Another boy behaved improperly at public worship.
Captain Mackay handed over the culprit to the chaplain
to be punished. Whitefield ordered him to be tied with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
cords, and to be kept tied till he learned, and could repeat,
the fifty-first Psalm from memory. The lad performed his
penance, repeated the Psalm with great solemnity, "in the
midst of the congregation," and was then released from his
ignominious bonds.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the voyage, Whitefield was seized
with the fever, from which all in the ship, except three or
four, had suffered. Habersham and another friend sat up
with him every night. He was bled thrice, was blistered,
and had an emetic. Gradually recovering from this serious
illness, he reached Savannah on Sunday evening, May 7th,
more than four months after he had parted with his friends
in London.</p>

<p>On the day before his arrival, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"God has been pleased graciously to visit me with a violent fever,
which He so sweetened by Divine consolations, that I was enabled to
rejoice and sing in the midst of it. I was, as I thought, on the brink of
eternity. I had heaven within me. I thought of nothing in this world.
I earnestly desired to be dissolved and go to Christ; but God was pleased
to order it otherwise, and I am resigned, though I can scarce be reconciled,
to come back again into this vale of misery. I had the heavenly
Canaan in full view, and hoped I was going to take possession of it; but
God saw I was not yet ripe for glory, and, therefore, in mercy spared me,
that I may recover my spiritual strength before I go hence, and am no
more seen."</p></blockquote>

<p>One more fact respecting Whitefield's voyage to Savannah
must be added. Though extremely weak, and still suffering
from his recent fever, the young missionary was unwilling to
leave the ship, where he had spent four happy months,
without preaching a farewell sermon. His text (Psalm cvii.
30, 31) was most appropriate, and so also was his sermon,
which was published by James Hutton, a few months afterwards.
(8vo., 19 pp.) "God forbid," cried the ardent preacher,
standing within the shade of the outspread sails of the ship
<em>Whitaker</em>, lying at anchor at the mouth of Savannah river,
on Sunday, May 7, 1738:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"God forbid that any of those should ever suffer the vengeance of
eternal fire, amongst whom I have for these four months been preaching
the Gospel of Christ; and yet thus must it be, if you do not improve the
Divine mercies; and, instead of your being my crown of rejoicing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
day of our Lord Jesus Christ, I must appear as a swift witness against
you.</p>

<p>"But, brethren, I am persuaded better things of you, and things that
accompany salvation, though I thus speak. Blessed be God! some
marks of a partial reformation, at least, have been visible amongst all
you that are soldiers. My weak, though sincere, endeavours to build you
up in the knowledge and fear of God have not been altogether vain.
Swearing, I hope, is in a great measure abated with you; and God, I
trust, has blessed His late visitations by making them the means of
awakening your consciences to a more solicitous enquiry about the things
which belong to your everlasting peace. Consider, my good friends, you
are now, as it were, entering on a new world, where you will be surrounded
by multitudes of heathens; and, if you take not heed to 'have
your conversation honest among them, and to walk worthy the holy vocation
wherewith you are called,' you will act the hellish part of Herod's
soldiers, and cause Christ's religion, as they did His person, to be had in
derision of those who are round about you. I cannot say I have discharged
my duty to you as I ought. No; I am sensible of many faults,
for which I have not failed to humble myself in secret before God. As
for your military affairs, I have nothing to do with them. Fear God, and
you must honour the king. Nor am I better acquainted with the nature
of that land which you are come to protect; only this I may venture to
affirm in general, that you must necessarily expect, upon your arrival at a
new colony, to meet with many difficulties. But your very profession
teaches you to endure hardship. Be not, therefore, faint-hearted, but quit
yourselves like men, and be strong.</p>

<p>"As I have spoken to you, I hope your wives also will suffer the word
of exhortation. Your behaviour on shipboard, especially the first part of
the voyage, I choose to throw a cloak over; for, to use the mildest term,
it was not such as became the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. However,
of late, blessed be God! you have taken more heed to your ways, and
some of you have walked all the while as became women professing
godliness. Let those accept my hearty thanks; and permit me to entreat
you all in general, as you are all now married, to remember the solemn
vow you made at your entrance into the marriage state; and see that you
be subject to your own husbands, in every lawful thing. Beg of God to
keep the door of your lips, that you offend not with your tongues; and
walk in love, that your prayers be not hindered. You who have children,
let it be your chief concern to breed them up in the nurture and monition
of the Lord. And live all of you so holy and unblamable, that you may
not so much as be suspected to be unchaste; and, as some of you have
imitated Mary Magdalene in her sin, strive to imitate her also in her
repentance."</p></blockquote>

<p>After this manly address to the soldiers and their wives,
Whitefield proceeded, in the same strain, to speak to the
sailors; and then thus addressed the two captains, naval and
military, who were present:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am positive neither you sailors nor the soldiers have wanted, nor will
want, any manner of encouragement to piety and holiness of living from
those two persons who have here the government over you; for they have
been such helps to me in my ministry, and have so readily concurred in
everything for your good, that they may justly demand a public acknowledgment
of thanks both from you and me.</p>

<p>"Permit me, then, my honoured friends, in the name of both your
people, to return you hearty thanks for the care and tenderness you have
expressed for the welfare of their better parts. As for the private favours
you have shewn to myself, I hope so deep a sense of them is imprinted on
my heart, that I shall plead them before God in prayer as long as I shall
live. But I have still stronger obligations to intercede on your behalf;
for God&mdash;for ever adored be His free grace in Christ Jesus!&mdash;has set His
seal to my ministry in your hearts. Some pangs of the new birth I have
observed to come upon you; and God forbid that I should sin against the
Lord, by ceasing to pray that the good work begun in you may be carried
on till the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"And now, brethren, into God's hands I commend your spirits. Excuse
my detaining you so long. Perhaps it is the last time I shall speak to you.
My heart is full, and, out of the abundance of it, I could continue my discourse
till midnight. But I must away to your new world. May God
give you new hearts, and enable you to put in practice what you have
heard from time to time to be your duty. Then God will so bless you,
that you will 'build cities to dwell in;' then will you sow your lands and
plant vineyards, which will 'yield you fruits of increase.' Then your
'oxen shall be strong to labour, there shall be no leading into captivity,
and no complaining in your streets; then shall your sons grow up as the
young plants, and your daughters be as the polished corners of the temple;
then shall your garners be full and plenteous with all manner of store,
and your sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in your streets.'
In short, then shall the Lord be your God; and, as surely as He hath
now brought us to His haven, so surely, after we have passed through the
storms and tempests of this troublesome world, will He bring us to the
haven of eternal rest, where we shall have nothing to do but to praise
Him for ever for His goodness, and declare, in never-ceasing songs of
praise, the wonders he has done for us, and all the other sons of men."</p></blockquote>

<p>This was a noble finish of Whitefield's shipboard ministry.
No wonder that the juvenile preacher was loved and followed.</p>

<p>Whitefield, thousands of miles from home, now stood on
the shores of the immense continent of America&mdash;a continent
extending from the north pole to the fifty-seventh degree
of south latitude,&mdash;upwards of eight thousand miles in length&mdash;washed
on the east by the great Atlantic Ocean, which
divides it from Europe and Africa, and on the west by the
Pacific, by which it is disjoined from Asia,&mdash;in reality, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
vast continents, the one north, the other south, united by
Mexico.</p>

<p>At the time of Whitefield's arrival, the whole of South
America (excepting Brazil, which belonged to Portugal) and
all that part of North America which forms the isthmus of
Mexico, and the country extending as far as Florida, was
possessed by Spain. English territory reached from Hudson's
Bay, all along the eastern shore to the thirtieth degree of
north latitude. The French had Canada, and claimed the
country lying between there and the Spanish settlements to
the west. A description of this enormous region of mountains,
prairies, swamps, forests, lakes and rivers, with every
variety of climate and production that the earth affords,
cannot be here attempted.</p>

<p>Many immense tracts of country could scarcely be said to
have any population whatever; and yet there was an almost
countless number of Indian tribes, differing but little from each
other in their usages and manners, and forming a striking
picture of human antiquity. Most of them were tall and
strong, their countenances fierce, and their skins brown,
and not improved by the constant use of rude cosmetics.
The only occupations of the men were war and hunting.
Agriculture was left to the women. Most of their time,
however, was spent in sleeping, loitering, jesting among their
friends, and eating and drinking enormously. Some held
the existence of a Supreme Being; but none knew how to
worship Him. They abounded in superstitions, observed
omens and dreams, pryed into futurity with the utmost
eagerness, and greatly relied on diviners, augurs, and magicians,
in all affairs that concerned them, whether of health,
war, or hunting.</p>

<p>But enough of this. For the present, Georgia only was
Whitefield's sphere of labour. In the year 1732, the Government
of England, observing that a large tract of land,
between Carolina and the borders of the Spanish Florida,
was uncultivated and unsettled, resolved to erect it into a
separate province, and to found a colony. They were
induced to do this, (1) because the land lay on the frontier
of all the English provinces, naked and defenceless, and
exposed Carolina especially to attacks from the Spaniards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and Indians; and (2) because it was believed that the region
might be utilised by the growth of wine, oil, and silk. This
useless territory extended along the Atlantic coast for a distance
of about sixty miles; and into the interior, from a
hundred and fifty to three hundred miles, as far as the
Alleghany mountains.</p>

<p>Carolina, the adjoining province, had been formed into an
English settlement in 1663. One portion of the colonists
were Churchmen; another, quite as large, were Dissenters,
who had escaped, as refugees, from tyrannising governments.
There were numerous quarrellings between the two classes of
religionists. This was bad enough, but it was not the only
evil. Eight English noblemen had obtained a charter for
the property and jurisdiction of the country. John Locke,
the great philosopher, had compiled its fundamental laws.
The lordly proprietors stood in the place of the king,
appointed all officers, and bestowed all titles of dignity.
The people were dissatisfied with the proceedings of their
governors, and violent disputes followed. Then there were
two wars with the Indian tribes; and, as a consequence of
the whole, the colony was almost torn to pieces. Ten years
before Whitefield's embarkation, the Parliament of England
put the province under the immediate care and inspection
of the Crown. Peace was soon established with all the
neighbouring Indian nations&mdash;the Cherokees, the Creeks,
and the Catuabas; Carolina, north and south, was delivered
from its internal quarrels; and now trade was advancing
with astonishing rapidity.</p>

<p>The climate of Carolina and of the adjoining region, now
called Georgia, was one of the finest in the world. The soil
of both countries was marvellously rich. Where cultivated,
oranges, olives, rice, indigo, wheat, peas, and Indian corn
were grown in great abundance. Most of the land, however,
was entirely untilled, and consisted of swamps of black fat
earth, immense forests of oaks and pines, and, here and there,
luxuriant glades, overrun with flowering shrubs and plants
the most beautiful.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p>Though the Georgian colony was now only six years
old, five companies of emigrants had already landed. 1. The
motley band of released debtors, a hundred and twenty in
number, who arrived with Oglethorpe, in February, 1733.
2. The Saltzburghers, who set sail from Dover on January 8,
1734. 3. A number of Scotch islanders, who founded New
Inverness, in Darien. 4. Two different sets of Moravians,
with one of whom Wesley and his brother sailed. These
were Whitefield's parishioners, most of them foreign refugees,
a few of them Presbyterian Highlanders, and the rest chiefly
insolvent debtors, whom the hand of charity had rescued
from London prisons. Wesley's life among them had been
embittered by all kinds of vexations, to a great extent engendered
by his endeavouring to enforce High-Church discipline.
How did Whitefield succeed? His present sojourn was not
of long continuance&mdash;only four months&mdash;but it comprised
numerous incidents worthy of being noticed.</p>

<p>Weak as Whitefield was, from his late attack of fever, as
soon as he reached Savannah, he "joined in prayer and a
psalm of thanksgiving" with Charles Delamotte, whom
Wesley had left behind, and with "some pious souls," who
rejoiced at his arrival.</p>

<p>Next morning, May 8, as early as five o'clock, the ardent
evangelist commenced his public labours by reading the
Liturgy, and expounding the second lesson "to seventeen
adults and twenty-five children." This was Whitefield's first
congregation in America. During the day, he had an interview
with the notorious Thomas Causton (the bitter enemy
of Wesley), and with the other magistrates of this Liliputian
kingdom of about five hundred souls. He says, they received
him "with great civility;" and it was resolved by their
magisterial highnesses that "he should have a house and
tabernacle built at Frederica, and should serve at Savannah,
when, and as long as he pleased." Whitefield adds: "I
find there are many divisions amongst the inhabitants, but
God, I hope, will make me an instrument of composing
them."</p>

<p>Whitefield's ardour in commencing his public labours was
greater than his prudence. There was an immediate return
of fever, and, for the next few days, he was entirely disabled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
On Sunday, May 14, he "<em>attempted</em> to read prayers, but was
so faint and weak that he was obliged to leave off before he
began the second service."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Recovering a little strength, he set out, on May 19, to
visit Hampstead and Highgate, two of his parochial villages,
about five miles from Savannah. Hampstead consisted "of
three families, making in all eleven souls." The component
parts of this <em>Georgian village</em> population were two men, one
woman, and seven children&mdash;all from Switzerland; to whom,
by some odd accident, was added another man, a Jew.
Whitefield writes: "I was much delighted with seeing the
improvements a few pair of hands had made in their respective
plantations. Surely they speak not the truth, who
say that the Georgia people have been idle, for I never saw
more laborious people than are in these villages. I was at
a loss, because I could not talk French; but I resolved to
follow my worthy predecessor's (Wesley) example, and to
visit them once a week, and read prayers to as many as
could understand me. I also enquired into the state of their
children, and found there were many who might prove
useful members of the colony, if there was a proper place
for their maintenance and education. Nothing can effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
this but an orphan house, which might easily be erected, if
some of those who are rich in this world's goods would contribute
towards it."</p>

<p>The next day, May 20, Whitefield paid a visit to a
memorable man who merits a brief notice.</p>

<p>When Oglethorpe first went to Georgia, in 1733, he
found, between the coast and the Alleghany mountains,
three considerable nations of Indians&mdash;the Uchees, consisting
of two hundred men; the Upper Creek, having eleven
hundred men; and the Lower Creek, who had nine towns,
or rather cantons, and about a thousand men able to bear
arms. The chief of the last-mentioned tribe was Tomo
Chici, whose head-quarters was at a place called Yamacraw,
a short distance from Savannah. Oglethorpe waited upon
this Indian chief, and persuaded him to invite a deputation
from the other tribes to hold a conference with him at
Savannah. The conference took place in one of the newly
built houses, about fifty Indian chiefs and leading warriors
being present. Oglethorpe received them with his wonted
courtesy, and told them that the English, in coming to settle
there, did not intend either to dispossess or to annoy the
natives; but desired above all things to live in friendship
with them, and hoped, through those whom he now addressed,
to obtain from them a concession of a portion of their
territory, and to confirm a treaty of amity and commerce.
Ouechachumpa, a warrior of great stature, replied, and, after
describing the region which the natives wished to retain in
their own possession, declared the English were welcome to
all the rest. Tomo Chici then advanced, and, making a
low obeisance, said: "When these white men came, I feared
they would drive us away, for we were weak; but they
promised not to molest us. We wanted corn and other
things, and they have given us supplies; and now, of our
small means, we make them presents in return. Here is a
buffalo skin, adorned with the head and feathers of an eagle.
The eagle signifies speed, and the buffalo strength. The
English are swift as the eagle, and strong as the buffalo.
Like the eagle, they flew over great waters; and, like the
buffalo, nothing can withstand them. But the feathers of
the eagle are soft, and signify kindness; and the skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of the buffalo is covering, and signifies protection. Let
these, then, remind them to be kind, and to protect us."
The terms of alliance were speedily agreed upon; and
Oglethorpe presented to each chief, a laced coat, a hat,
and a shirt; to each war captain, he gave a gun, and
ammunition; and to the attendants, mantles of coarse cloth
and smaller presents.</p>

<p>The friendship thus commenced with Tomo Chici was life-long.
In 1734, when Oglethorpe returned to England, Tomo
Chici, with his wife and nephew, Hillispilli, the war captain
of his tribe, five chiefs of the Creeks, and Umpichi, a chief
from Palachicolas, with their interpreter and attendants,
accompanied him, because he thought it would promote the
interests of Georgia if some of the principal natives were to
see Great Britain, and become impressed with its power and
dignity. Comfortable quarters were provided for the Indians
at the Georgia office; and, after being suitably attired, and
having their faces painted after their fashion, they were conveyed,
in three of the royal carriages, to Kensington Palace,
and presented to George II. and his Queen Caroline. Tomo
Chici addressed to the king one of his flowery speeches;
and the king returned an appropriate reply. They were
then introduced to Queen Caroline, to the Prince of Wales,
to the Duke of Cumberland, and to the Princesses. One of
their party died of smallpox, and was interred in the churchyard
of St. John's, Westminster. Oglethorpe took them to
his country residence. They likewise visited Lambeth Palace,
where they were agreeably entertained by the Archbishop
of Canterbury. They were also taken to Eton College,
Windsor Castle, St. George's Chapel, Hampton Court, the
Tower of London, Greenwich Hospital, and, in short, to all
the great sights in the metropolis and its vicinity.</p>

<p>After a four months' residence in England, they rode, in
royal carriages, to Gravesend, and embarked for Georgia, where,
with a company of Saltzburghers, they arrived in safety.</p>

<p>On February 14, 1736, Tomo Chici, his nephew and
heir, and several others, as soon as they heard of the
arrival of the ship, came to welcome Wesley to Georgia.
"I am glad you are come," said the chief. "When I was
in England, I desired that some would speak the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Word to me; and my nation then desired to hear it; but
now we are all in confusion. Yet I am glad you are come.
I will go up and speak to the wise men of our nation;
and I hope they will hear. But we would not be made
Christians as the Spaniards make Christians. We would
be taught, before we are baptized."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>A month after this, Tomo Chici and forty of his Indians
set out with Oglethorpe on an expedition, in the course of
which they reached a fine island hitherto called <em>Wissoo</em>, but
which the chief on this occasion re-named Cumberland, in
honour of the young Prince, who had been very gracious
to the Indians when in England, particularly to the chief's
nephew, to whom His Royal Highness had given a gold
repeating watch.</p>

<p>Tomo Chici, on this and other occasions, shewed himself a
sincere friend of Oglethorpe and the English settlers; but
he hesitated to declare himself a Christian. When Wesley
urged him to embrace the doctrines of Christianity, he
significantly answered: "Why, these are Christians at
Savannah! Those are Christians at Frederica! Christians
get drunk! Christians beat men! Christians tell lies!
Me no Christian!"</p>

<p>This was the man whom Whitefield visited a few days
after his arrival in Georgia. The old chief was dangerously
ill, and "lay on a blanket, thin and meagre&mdash;little else but
skin and bones." His wife, Senauki, "sat by fanning him
with Indian feathers." Tooanahowi, his nephew, was the
only one present who understood the English language, and
through him Whitefield asked the chief whether he thought
he was about die? Tomo Chici answered, "I cannot tell."
"I then asked," says Whitefield, "where he thought he
would go after death? He replied, To heaven." To this
brief dialogue, Whitefield adds: "But, alas! how can a
drunkard enter there? I then exhorted Tooanahowi (who
is a tall proper youth) not to get drunk, and asked him
whether he believed a heaven? He answered, Yes. I then
asked whether he believed a hell? and described it by pointing
to the fire. He replied, No."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Tomo Chici partially recovered from his present illness;
and when Oglethorpe arrived a few months afterwards, he,
with several other chiefs, came to meet and welcome him,
declaring that the coming of "The Great Man," as he called
the governor, quite restored him, and made him "moult like
the eagle."</p>

<p>In the following year, 1739, the venerable chief, who
had nearly reached his hundredth year, tranquilly expired.
Having expressed a wish to be buried at Savannah, his
remains were brought by water from Yamacraw, and were
received at the landing-place by Oglethorpe, the Savannah
magistrates, and the people. The pall was borne by the
general and five other gentlemen; and the body, followed
by the Indian mourners, was interred with military honours.
Tooanahowi, his nephew, succeeded to the chieftain dignities,
and proved as faithful and firm a friend to the English
settlers as his centenarian uncle had been.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Four days after his visit to Tomo Chici, Whitefield and
Charles Delamotte went to Thunderbolt, a village, as it was
called, about six miles distant, "and consisting of three
families, four men and two women, and ten servants."
Here he "expounded a chapter, and used a few collects;"
and returned to Savannah, saying, "Blessed be God for
strengthening my weak body!"</p>

<p>On Friday, June 2, he had to part with "kind Captain
Whiting," and his "dear friend Delamotte, who embarked
for England."<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Concerning the latter, he writes: "The
poor people lamented the loss of him, and went to the water-side
to take a last farewell. And good reason had they to
do so; for he has been indefatigable in feeding Christ's
lambs with the sincere milk of the word, and many of them
have grown thereby. Surely I must labour most heartily,
since I come after such worthy predecessors. The good
which Mr. John Wesley has done in America, under God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
is inexpressible. His name is very precious among the
people; and he has laid a foundation that I hope neither
men nor devils will ever be able to shake."</p>

<p>A week later, Whitefield appointed one of his friends,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> who
had accompanied him from England, to open a school at
Highgate, for the purpose of teaching the children of the
French, there and at Hampstead, the English language;
so that he and his successors might be able to catechise
them, and bring them to church to hear the word of God.
He also opened a school for girls at Savannah; another
friend, "whose heart God had touched," on board the
<em>Whitaker</em>, having consented to teach them. "The work,"
writes the hopeful and penniless young preacher, "is for
my Master, and, therefore, I doubt not of being supplied,
some way or another, with a sufficient fund for the support
of it."</p>

<p>Though Whitefield was an enormous letter-writer, it is a
curious fact, that, of all the letters written during his present
visit to America, only one has been preserved. It is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Savannah</span>, <em>June 10, 1738</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dearest Sir</span>,&mdash;I have been about five weeks at Savannah, where
providence seems to intend me to abide for some time. God has
graciously visited me with a fit of sickness; but now I am as lively as a
young eagle. All things have happened better than was expected.
America is not so horrid a place as it is represented to be. The heat of
the weather, lying on the ground, etc., are mere painted lions in the way,
and, to a soul filled with divine love, not worth mentioning.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The country,
mornings and evenings, is exceeding pleasant, and there are uncommon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
improvements made in divers places. With a little assistance, the country
people would do very well. As for my ministerial office, God (such is His
goodness) sets His seal to it here, as at other places. We have an excellent
Christian school, and near a hundred constantly attend at evening prayers.
The people receive me gladly into their houses, and seem to be most kindly
affected towards me. I have a pretty little family, and find it possible to
manage a house without distraction. We have provisions to feed us,
though we are cut off from all occasions to pamper our bodies. I visit
from house to house, catechise, read prayers twice and expound the two
second lessons, every day; read to a house full of people three times a
week; expound two lessons at five in the morning, read prayers and
preach twice, and expound the catechism at seven in the evening every
Sunday. What I have most at heart is the building an orphan house,
which I trust will be effected at my return to England. In the meanwhile,
I am settling little schools in and about Savannah, that the rising generation
may be bred up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. The
Lord prosper my weak endeavours for promoting His glory and His
people's good!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was Whitefield's Sunday and week-day work,&mdash;upon
an average two and a half public services every day,
and four on Sundays.</p>

<p>On the 10th of July, he went to Ebenezer, the place
where the Saltzburghers were settled, and wrote concerning
them: "They are blessed with two such pious ministers as
I have not often seen.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> They have no courts of judicature,
but all little differences are immediately decided by their
ministers, whom they look upon and love as their fathers.
They have likewise an Orphan House, in which are seventeen
children, and one widow, and I was much delighted to
see the regularity wherewith it was managed. I gave Mr.
Boltzius, one of their ministers, some of my poor's store for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
his orphans. He called them all before him; catechised
and exhorted them to give God thanks for His good providence
towards them; then prayed with them, and made
them pray after him; then sung a psalm; and, afterwards,
the little lambs came and shook me by the hand one by
one. So we parted, and I scarce was ever better pleased in
my life."</p>

<p>Wherever he went, Whitefield was beloved. Even the
mongrel population of Savannah treated him with affectionate
respect. He writes: "They seem to have a sincere
affection for me, and flock (especially every evening) to hear
the word of God. They everywhere receive me with the
utmost civility, and are not angry when I reprove them. I
have endeavoured to let my gentleness be known amongst
them, because they consist of different nations and opinions;
and I have striven to draw them by the cords of love,
because the obedience resulting from that principle I take to
be the most genuine and lasting."</p>

<p>In the month of August, Whitefield visited Frederica,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
a town above a hundred miles from Savannah, "and
consisting of about a hundred and twenty inhabitants."
Two years ago, the ill-natured inhabitants of Frederica
had worried Charles Wesley almost into madness; but
Whitefield says: "The people received me most gladly,
having had a famine of the word for a long season."
Though timber was being sawn for the purpose, as yet no
church had been built; and Whitefield's first service was
under a large tree, where he read prayers and expounded
the Second Lesson.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> "Poor creatures!" said he, "my
heart ached for them, because I saw them and their children
scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd."</p>

<p>During his five days' stay at Frederica, he paid a flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
visit to Darien, about twenty miles distant, where the Highlanders
were settled, his object being to hold Christian
fellowship with Mr. McLeod, whom he describes as "a
worthy minister of the Scotch Church."</p>

<p>On the 16th of August, he again arrived at Savannah,
where he spent the next twelve days; at the end of which
he set sail for England. During this brief interval, two
events occurred which must be noticed.</p>

<p>The first was his refusal to read the Burial Service over a
dead infidel.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Whitefield had frequently visited the man
during his lingering illness, and had offered to pray with
him, which he would not permit. Two days before his
death, Whitefield asked him, "Do you believe Jesus Christ to
be God, the one Mediator between God and man?" The
answer was, "I believe Christ was a good man." "Do you
believe the Holy Scriptures?" "I believe," replied he,
"something of the Old Testament&mdash;the New I do not
believe at all." "Do you believe a judgment to come?"
"I know not what to say to that," answered the dying sceptic.
Whitefield writes: "The day after his decease, he was carried
to the ground, and I refused to read the office over him, but
went to the grave and told the people what had passed
between him and me; warned them against infidelity; and
asked them whether I could safely say, 'As our hope is
this our brother doth.' Upon which I believe they were
thoroughly satisfied that I had done right."<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>The other event was of a more pleasing kind, namely, the
opening of a newly built school-house at Highgate. Only
three months had passed since Whitefield's first visit there.
In the interval, one of the settlers had given him a site for
the erection; the rest had given labour; and now the building
was completed. Whitefield consecrated the edifice by
reading the Liturgy, preaching, baptizing an infant, and
catechising the children. "After the service," says the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
happy minister, "we refreshed ourselves together, thanked
our good God, and ate our bread with gladness of heart."</p>

<p>Whitefield's departure from Savannah, which took place
on August 28, was widely different from that of his
friend Wesley eight months before. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1738, August 28. This being the day of my departure, it was mostly
spent in taking leave of my flock, who expressed their affection now more
than ever.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> They came to me, from the morning to the time I left them,
with tears in their eyes, wishing me a prosperous voyage and safe return.
They also brought me wine, ale, cake, coffee, tea, and other things proper
for my passage, and their love seemed to be without dissimulation. My
heart was full, and I took the first opportunity of venting it by prayers and
tears. I think I never parted from a place with more regret. I have
great hope some good will come out of Savannah; because, the longer I
continued there, the larger the congregations grew. I scarce know a
night, though we had divine service twice a day, when the church-house
has not been nearly full."</p></blockquote>

<p>It will naturally be asked, if Whitefield was so happy in
his work in Georgia, why did he so soon leave it? An
answer to this will be found in the following extract from a
paper written some years afterwards. It will be seen,
1. That there were certain things in the government of the
country which Whitefield wished to have altered. 2. That he
felt it a duty to collect funds for the erection of an orphan
house. 3. That it was necessary he should return to
England to be ordained a priest. As an explanation of
what follows, it may be added here, that the Trustees of
Georgia, from the best of motives, had, 1. Prohibited the
introduction of ardent spirits,&mdash;a prohibition which it was
difficult to enforce, and which led to clandestine traffic.
2. They had granted lands to none but <em>male</em> emigrants, and
had issued a regulation to the effect that <em>female</em> descendants
should not inherit the estates of their ancestors. In families<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
of daughters, this was a grievance that soon created a just
discontent. 3. The Trustees also interdicted the introduction
of slaves. "Slavery," said Oglethorpe, "is against the Gospel
as well as against the fundamental law of England." Besides,
he adds, the colony is "an asylum for the distressed, and it is
necessary, therefore, not to permit slaves in such a country,
for slaves starve the poor labourer." Such were some of
the reasons for this interdict; but it is a curious fact, that
as early as the year 1736, several "of the better sort of
people in Savannah" had sent a petition to the Trustees
"for the use of negroes."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Not only in one, but in all
these respects, Whitefield, oddly enough, sympathised with
the malcontent inhabitants of Georgia. Hear what he
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The people were denied the use both of rum and slaves. The lands
were allotted them according to a particular plan, whether good or bad;
and the female heirs were prohibited from inheriting. So that in reality
to place people there, on such a footing, was little better than to tie their
legs and bid them walk. The scheme was well meant at home; but was
absolutely impracticable in so hot a country abroad. However, that
rendered what I had brought over from my friends more acceptable to the
poor inhabitants, and gave me an ocular demonstration of the great
necessity of an orphan house, which I now determined to set about
in earnest. The Saltzburghers at Ebenezer had one; and having heard
and read of what Professor Francke had done in that way, in Germany, I
confidently hoped that something of the like nature might succeed in
Georgia. Many poor orphans were there already, and the number was
likely soon to be increased.</p>

<p>"The settlers were chiefly broken and decayed tradesmen from London
and other parts of England; several Scotch adventurers; some Highlanders,
who had a worthy minister named McLeod; a few Moravians;
and the Saltzburghers, who were by far the most industrious of the
whole.</p>

<p>"With the worthy ministers of Ebenezer, Messrs. Grenaw and Boltzius,
I contracted an intimacy. Many praying people were in the congregation,
which, with the consideration that such faithful labourers as Messrs.
Wesleys and Ingham had been sent, gave me great hope that, unpromising
as the aspect at present might be, the colony might emerge in time out of
its infant state. Mr. Ingham had made some small advances towards
converting the Indians, who were at a small settlement about four miles
from Savannah. He went and lived among them for a few months, and
began to compose an Indian Grammar; but he was soon called away to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
England. Mr. Charles Wesley had chiefly acted as secretary to General
Oglethorpe; but he also soon went to England to engage more labourers.
Mr. John Wesley, having met with unworthy treatment, both at Frederica
and Savannah, soon followed. Through Divine mercy, I met with respectable
treatment from magistrates, officers, and people. The first I visited now
and then; the others, besides preaching twice a day and four times a
Lord's day, I visited from house to house. I was in general most cordially
received; but, from time to time, found that '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cælum non animum mutant
qui trans mare currunt.</i>' Though lowered in their circumstances, a sense
of what they formerly were in their native country remained. It was
plain to be seen that coming over was not so much out of choice
as constraint. Among some of these, however, the word took effectual
root. I was really happy in my little foreign cure, and could have cheerfully
remained among them, had I not been obliged to return to England
to receive priest's orders and to make a beginning towards laying a
foundation to the orphan house."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Here then are Whitefield's reasons why, after so short a
residence, he left Savannah, and set sail for England.</p>

<p>First of all, in a boat provided by Thomas Causton,
Wesley's foe, he made his way to Charleston, the capital
of Carolina, where, says he, "I was received in a most Christian
manner by the Bishop of London's Commissary, the Rev.
Mr. Garden, a good soldier of Jesus Christ;"<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and was
treated with great kindness by several others. Here he
remained about ten days, and then, on September 9,
embarked on board the <em>Mary</em>, Captain Coc, commander,
bound from Charleston to England.</p>

<p>With the exception of two or three days, the first month
of the passage home was a continual storm. During the
first week, Whitefield never undressed, and lay upon deck,
or on a chest, every night. On October 3, when they had
sailed about 150 miles, they encountered a tempest which
slit nearly all their sails to strips. The captain's hammock,
in the great cabin, was half filled with water. Whitefield,
in his berth, was drenched. Most of the fresh provisions
were washed overboard; and the tackling of the ship was
seriously injured. In the midst of all, however, Whitefield
was kept in peace. "God," says he, "was exceeding gracious
unto me, and enabled me greatly to rejoice. My sphere of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
action was now contracted into a very narrow compass; for
there are but few souls on board, and all that I can do is
to read public prayers, and add a word of exhortation, twice
every day. The captain and all are very civil."</p>

<p>Whitefield did not forget his friends. On the 2nd of
October, he wrote a long letter "to the Inhabitants of
Savannah,"&mdash;a sort of pastoral epistle&mdash;in which he strongly
insists upon that which had so often been the subject of his
sermons&mdash;"the new birth in Christ Jesus&mdash;that ineffable
change which must pass upon our hearts before we can see
God." "The author of this blessed change," says he, "is
the Holy Ghost; and the means to attain this Holy Spirit,
you know, and the way you know." It is a remarkable
fact, however, that, whilst specifying the <em>means</em>, as 1. Self-denial;
2. Public Worship; 3. Reading the Scriptures; 4.
Secret Prayer; 5. Self-examination; and 6. Receiving the
blessed Sacrament,&mdash;there is not a word about faith in
Christ; and, further, it is equally remarkable that, until after
this, the doctrine of salvation by faith in Christ only, is never
even mentioned in any of Whitefield's published sermons,
nor in any of his private letters to his friends. The fact is,
whilst he himself fully trusted in the infinite sacrifice of
Christ as the alone <em>procuring</em> cause of a sinner's salvation, he
had yet to learn that the doctrine of justification by faith
alone, is not only a doctrine of <em>paramount importance</em> in the
great scheme of Christian truth, but one which stands pre-eminent
throughout the whole of the New Testament
Scriptures. The Wesley brothers, in this very year, 1738,
to their own great amazement, had been brought to the
knowledge of this unspeakably important dogma of revealed
religion, and had begun to preach it. A few months later,
Whitefield was led to embrace the same doctrine, and had
the same divine conviction; and henceforward, to the end
of life, was second to none in expounding and enforcing the
text of the inspired Apostle, "To him that worketh not, but
believeth on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is
counted for righteousness."</p>

<p>But leaving this, and returning to Whitefield's pastoral
epistle, while defective in the momentous point just mentioned,
it is in all other respects most admirable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I must defer," says he, "dwelling further on this subject till I see you
in person, and am qualified to administer unto you the sacred symbols of
Christ's blessed body and blood. In the meanwhile, think not that I
shall forget you in my prayers. No, I remember my promise, and, whilst
the winds and storms are blowing over me, I make supplication to God
on your behalf. Remember, my dear friends, that, for the space of near
four months, I ceased not, day and night, warning every one of you to
repent and turn to God, and bring forth fruits meet for repentance. Repent
you, therefore, and walk in all things as becometh the Gospel of our Lord
Jesus Christ, and then, and then only, shall your sins be blotted out.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
Let there be no divisions among you; for a kingdom divided against itself
cannot stand. Be over-careful for nothing, but, in everything, with supplications
and thanksgiving, make your wants known unto God. Speak not
evil one of another, but live at peace among yourselves; and the God of
peace shall in all things direct and rule your hearts. Brethren, pray that
God would prosper the work of His hands upon me, and restore me to
you as soon as possible. In about eight months, God willing, I hope to
see you. In the meanwhile, you shall not be forgotten by your affectionate,
though unworthy, minister in Christ Jesus,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was Whitefield's letter, written in the midst of ocean-storms.
A fortnight later he wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"October 14. Sailed this week about 600 miles; but yesterday God
was pleased to send us a contrary wind, which still continues. A few
days ago, I flattered myself we should soon be at our desired port, but
God is pleased to defer the accomplishment of my hopes. However,
blessed be His name! He enables me to give thanks. Most of this week
has been spent in searching the Scriptures, and in retirements for direction
and assistance in the work before me. My fresh provisions are gone,
and the people are put to the allowance of a quart of water each man for
a day. I hope now the spiritual man will grow, having so little for the
natural man to feed upon. Amen, Lord Jesus! Blessed be God! By
His grace, I rejoice in necessities, and in everything give thanks. Had
this sentence out of Matthew Henry much pressed upon my heart, 'The
mower loses no time while he is whetting his scythe.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>On November 4, Whitefield remarked:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Our allowance of water now is but a pint a day, so that we dare not
eat much salt beef. Our sails are exceeding thin; some more of them
were split last night, and no one knows where we are; but God does,
and that is sufficient. Last night, He lifted up the light of His blessed
countenance upon me; and to-day, He fills me with joy unspeakable
and full of glory; so that, though I have little to eat, I inwardly possess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
all things. This is now the eighth week I have been on board. If my
friends ask me why I arrived no sooner, I may truly answer, Satan hindered
us; for I believe it is he who is permitted to do this."</p></blockquote>

<p>A week later he wrote again:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Still we are floating about, not knowing where we are; but our people
seem yet to have hopes of seeing Ireland. The weather now begins to
be cold, so that I can say with the Apostle, 'I am in hungerings and
thirstings, cold and fastings often.' My outward man sensibly decayeth,
but the spiritual man, I trust, is renewed day by day. Our ship is much
out of repair, and our food by no means enough to support nature; an
ounce or two of salt beef, a pint of water, and a cake made of flour and
skimmings of the pot; but I often think of Him who preserved Moses
in the ark of bulrushes, and so long as I look upwards, my faith will not
fail."</p></blockquote>

<p>The next day, land appeared. Their plight was pitiable.
They had but half a pint of water left. A boat
was sent on shore. Provisions and water were obtained;
and Mr. McMahon, "a great country gentleman," sent an
invitation to Whitefield to visit him, and to stay in his house
as long as he liked. "As soon as the provisions came,"
says Whitefield, "we kneeled down and returned hearty
thanks to our good God, who has heard our prayers, and
sent His angel before us to prepare our way." On November
14, the ship anchored near the west coast of Ireland, and
Whitefield landed. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The voyage has been greatly for my good; for I have had a glorious
opportunity of searching the Scriptures, composing discourses, writing
letters, and communing with my own heart. We have been on board
just nine weeks and three days,&mdash;a long and perilous, but profitable
voyage to my soul; for, I hope, it has taught me, in some measure, to
endure hardships as becometh a minister of Christ. My clothes have
not been off (except to change me) all the passage. Part of the time I
lay on open deck; part on a chest; and the remainder on a bedstead
covered with my buffalo's skin. These things, though little in themselves,
are great in their consequences; and, whosoever despiseth small
acts of bodily discipline, it is to be feared, will insensibly lose his spiritual
life by little and little. As for the success of my ministry whilst on board,
I shall only say, much sin has been prevented, and one I hope effectually
converted, who is to be my fellow-traveller to England."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. McMahon treated Whitefield with the genuine hospitality
of an Irish gentleman, and furnished him with three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
horses to convey him, his servant, and the new convert just
mentioned, from one side of Ireland to the other.</p>

<p>Their first day's journey brought them to Kilrush, where
they met Captain Coc and a number of his crew, who, the
night before, had been almost wrecked. Whitefield writes:
"On entering our inn, we kneeled down and prayed; and
again, at night, sung psalms, and prayed with the captain
and several of my shipmates; the first time, I believe, the
room was ever put to such a use by a ship's crew and their
chaplain."</p>

<p>Whilst here, undaunted by his recent privations and
dangers, Whitefield wrote to a friend in England:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Kilrush</span>, <em>Nov. 16, 1738</em>.
</p>

<p>"I send you this to inform you of my safe arrival here. I know you
will rejoice and give thanks, and pray that my coming to London may be
in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of peace. God has done for
me more abundantly than I could dare to ask or think. The seed of the
glorious gospel has taken root in the American ground, and, I hope, will
grow up into a great tree. America&mdash;infant Georgia&mdash;is an excellent soil
for Christianity; you cannot live there without taking up a daily cross;
therefore, I shall hasten back as soon as possible after Christmas."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield's second day's Irish journey was from Kilrush
to Fourthfargus,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> a distance of about thirty miles. Everywhere
he was struck with the poverty of the people, and
thought the huts in Georgia were palaces when compared
with the Irish turf and mud-built cabins. In this the
cold and wet month of November, he saw many of the
people walking barefoot, some because they were destitute
of shoes, and others carrying in their hands their "clouted
brogues" to save them from wearing out. Nearly all were
papists, and "seemed," says Whitefield, "so very ignorant
that they may well be termed the <em>wild Irish</em>."</p>

<p>On Saturday, November 19, he came to Limerick,
where he spent the Sunday. Dr. Burscough, Bishop
of Limerick, received him "with the utmost candour and
civility;" and, at his lordship's request, he preached in
the cathedral "to a very numerous audience, who seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
universally affected." After sermon, the mayor sent twice
to invite him to dinner; but he "was pre-engaged to the
bishop," who offered him "the free use of his palace."
"As I was eating at dinner," says Whitefield, "I was meditating
on the Divine goodness in spreading such a table for
me, when last Sunday I was in danger of perishing with
hunger. But I thought, at the same time, if this was so
great a blessing, what an infinitely greater one will it be,
after the troubles of this life, to sit down and eat bread in
the kingdom of God." The next day, when taking leave of
his lordship, "the good bishop kissed him, and said, 'Mr.
Whitefield, God bless you! I wish you success abroad.
Had you stayed in town, this house should have been your
home.'"</p>

<p>Three days afterwards, the weather-beaten hero arrived at
Dublin, and thus completed his journey of about 200 miles
across the "sister island," remarking that there were two
things for which Ireland deserved credit,&mdash;the roads were
good, and provisions cheap.</p>

<p>During the five days that Whitefield spent in Dublin, he
visited the celebrated Dr. Delany, who received him with the
greatest kindness. Through Delany, he was introduced to
Dr. Rundle, Bishop of Londonderry, and to Dr. Boulter,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
the Archbishop of Armagh, both of whom invited him to
dinner. He also preached in two of the Dublin churches&mdash;St.
Werburgh's and St. Andrew's&mdash;and says, "God enabled
me to speak with power."</p>

<p>On November 30, he landed at Parkgate, and hurried to
Nantwich, hoping to meet with his old friend, Mr. Matthew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Salmon, an Oxford Methodist, who, three years before, had
arranged to go with the Wesleys to Georgia, but, at the last
moment, was prevented by his family.</p>

<p>From Nantwich, Whitefield went to Manchester, to visit
another of the Oxford Methodists, the Rev. John Clayton,
by whose "judicious Christian conversation," says he, "I
was much edified." Here he spent Sunday, December 3,
and preached twice in Clayton's church, to thronged and
attentive congregations, and assisted six more clergymen in
administering the sacrament to three hundred communicants.
Five days afterwards, he arrived in London, "was received
with much joy" by his Christian friends, "joined with them
in psalms and thanksgiving," and, at night, went to a meeting
of the Moravian Society, in Fetter Lane.</p>

<p>At the time of Whitefield's arrival, Wesley was at Oxford;
but, hearing of his friend's return, he "hastened to London;"
and says, "On December 12, God gave us once more to
take sweet counsel together."</p>

<p>Strange things had happened during Whitefield's absence.
The two Wesleys had been brought into close connection
with the Moravians, and had both found peace with God
through faith in Christ. Charles had formed an intimate
acquaintance with the Rev. Henry Piers, of Bexley, and
with the Delamotte family, at Blendon. For seven months,
ever since the memorable "Day of Pentecost," in the month
of May, he had sung, rejoiced, and given thanks. Wherever
an opportunity occurred, he had preached, with all the
earnestness of his impulsive nature, his newly discovered
doctrine of a free salvation, attainable at once, by simple
faith in Christ. He had prayed with half a score of condemned
convicts in Newgate prison, had instructed them,
and then gone with them to Tyburn gallows. Besides occupying
the pulpits of other London churches, he had become
a sort of curate of the Rev. Mr. Stonehouse, vicar of Islington;
and, on September 3, had "preached salvation by faith" even
in Westminster Abbey, where he also "gave the cup."</p>

<p>John Wesley's history had been equally eventful. He had
met with Peter Bohler, and had been taught that true faith
in Christ is inseparably connected with dominion over sin,
and constant peace, arising from a sense of forgiveness&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
doctrine which, at the first, Wesley regarded as a "new
gospel." He had preached, before the University, in St.
Mary's, Oxford, his memorable sermon, from the text, "By
grace are ye saved, through faith." He had spent three
months in visiting the Moravian brotherhoods in Germany.
He and his brother had waited upon Dr. Gibson, Bishop of
London, to answer the complaints his lordship had heard
against them. He had drawn up a set of rules for the regulation
of the Moravian band societies in London; and he
had published his first "Collection of Psalms and Hymns."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
Though he had preached in several of the London churches,
his preaching, as yet, comparatively speaking, had not created
much excitement; but he was being prepared for action,
and, when the time arrived, he was ready for the battle.</p>

<p>Whitefield arrived in London on December 8, and, on
the day following, waited on the Archbishop of Canterbury
and the Bishop of London, and says he "met with a favourable
reception." All, however, was not smooth sailing. On
December 10, he writes: "Five churches have been already
denied me, and some of the clergy, if possible, would oblige
me to depart out of these coasts." As yet, however,
all the churches were not closed against him. On the
same day, he preached in St. Helen's,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> the church of
Broughton, the Oxford Methodist; and in the parish
church of Islington, where Mr. Stonehouse was vicar;
and concluded the Sabbath by attending a Moravian love-feast,
at Fetter Lane, and spending about two hours in prayer
and singing. He found that many who had been awakened
by his preaching, twelve months before, were now "grown
strong men in Christ, by the ministrations of his dear friends
and fellow-labourers, John and Charles Wesley;" and, in his
journal, he significantly adds: "I found the old doctrine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
justification by faith only much revived. Many letters had
been sent to me concerning it, all of which I, providentially,
missed receiving; for now I come unprejudiced, and can the
more easily see who is right. And who dare assert that we
are not justified in the sight of God merely by an act of
faith in Jesus Christ, without any regard to works past,
present, or to come?" So far as there is evidence to shew,
this was a doctrine which, up to the present, Whitefield had
never preached. Now, somewhat to his surprise, he found
the Moravians and the Wesley brothers preaching it continually.</p>

<p>With the exception of St. Helen's in Bishopsgate Street,
Christ Church in Spitalfields, Wapping Chapel, and the
parish church at Islington, Whitefield, on his return from
Georgia, was excluded from all the London churches. A
year ago, his popularity in London was enormous. Not only
the pulpits of the churches just mentioned, but those of
Cripplegate, St. Ann's (Foster Lane), the Tower, Ludgate,
Newgate, Bow Church (in Cheapside), St. Andrew (Holborn),
St. Antholin, St. Nicholas, and many others, were freely
offered him. Now, nearly all were shut against him. Why
was this? Perhaps it was partly occasioned by the imprudent
publication of his two "Journals of a Voyage from
London to Gibraltar, and from Gibraltar to Savannah"&mdash;journals
full of devotion, faith, and godly zeal, but yet
containing words, phrases, and sentences which it was unwise
to print. There was nothing absolutely wrong, but occasionally
there was a modicum of pious egotism, and there were
rapturous expressions unfamiliar to Pharisaic ears, and which
exposed the writer to the malignant shafts of inferior men,
who were envious of the preacher's popularity and success.
Another reason may, perhaps, be found in the fact that
Whitefield and the Wesley brothers were known to be faithful
and ardent friends. Though the Wesleys had not, as
yet, encountered any serious opposition, their newly embraced
doctrine of justification by faith only, and their
intimate and open connection with the London Moravians,
had been, to many of the members of the Church of
England, an occasion of huge offence; and it is not improbable
that Whitefield's exclusion from the London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
churches was partly on their account. And, further, though
the terrible storm of persecution had yet to come and burst,
there were already mutterings of its approach, and of its
violence. As an antidote to Whitefield's doctrine of the
new birth, the Rev. Tipping Silvester had published a
sermon,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> preached before the University of Oxford, the chief
point of which was that men are born again in baptism.
Further, in condemnation of Wesley's doctrine, that true faith
in Christ is inseparably attended by an assurance of the forgiveness
of sins, the Rev. Arthur Bedford, Chaplain to His
Royal Highness Frederick Prince of Wales, had printed a
discourse, delivered in the church of St. Lawrence Jewry, in
which he strongly argued that, to profess to have received
such an assurance, savours of spiritual pride, and cannot but
produce bad results. It is a "grand enthusiasm;" "instead
of bringing a man nearer to heaven, it sets him farther from
it, for the whole tenor of the gospel is to teach us humility
and lowliness of mind." "If," continues Mr. Bedford, "it
pleased God, by His Holy Spirit, to give me such an assurance,
I should think myself obliged heartily to bless His
name for it in private, and humbly beg a continuance of
it; but I should also think myself obliged, in conscience to
conceal it, unless I was called forth to martyrdom."</p>

<p>It is more than probable that all these things contributed
to Whitefield's being denied the use of those London pulpits
from which, only twelve months before, he had preached, to
admiring crowds, with such startling eloquence and power.
But, perhaps, the chief cause of his exclusion was the publication
of an 8vo. pamphlet, of thirty-two pages, with the
following title: "Remarks on the Reverend Mr. Whitefield's
Journal. Wherein his many Inconsistencies are pointed out,
and his Tenets considered. The whole shewing the dangerous
tendency of his Doctrine. Addressed to the Religious
Societies. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex tuo ipsius ore te damnabo.</i>" The pamphlet was
a weak performance, but full of venom. The writer professes
a great regard for truth and the general good of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Religious Societies, and confesses that Whitefield's "zeal to
promote the glory of God in London had made him esteem
and admire him;" but he adds that, finding "so many inconsistencies
and false notions of religion in" Whitefield's
Journal, "I could not help endeavouring to undeceive others,
since I am so much deceived in him myself."</p>

<p>The "Remarks on the Journal" are scarcely worthy of
quotation. Suffice it to say that, besides accusing Whitefield
of "placing religion in perturbations of mind, possessions
of God, ecstatic flights, and supernatural impulses;" of
"insinuating that he was a peculiar favourite of heaven,"
and of "arriving at such a height of enthusiasm as to
cause intervals of madness,"&mdash;the zealous reviewer of
Whitefield and his religion addresses the Religious Societies
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am not a stranger to those causeless divisions among you, occasioned
by Mr. Whitefield's doctrine, and others of his stamp, which have
even drove some of you into despair, and have caused others (really pious
and well-meaning people) not to be easy in themselves, but to think their
eternal happiness forfeited, through a want of those feelings which he
prescribes as the necessary ingredient for a good Christian. I shall leave
it to you to think whether any doctrine, attended with such melancholic
and frightful consequences, can be a means of promoting the glory of
God and benefiting mankind. I doubt not but you will think in the
negative. If so, let me exhort each of you, according to his power, to
endeavour to suppress it. The only means that I can recommend to you
is to work on those who are falling from you by gentle means; to remove
from their minds all vain expectations of these new tokens of the Spirit,
<em>pangs</em>, <em>feelings</em>, and the like; and to inform them that the only <em>fruit</em> of
the Spirit is righteousness; and always to keep up in them a sense that
their services, being according to their best endeavours (though imperfect),
will be acceptable with God, through the merits of Christ. This will preserve
them from despair, and be the only means to prevent those frightful
thoughts affecting the mind. But if they should at any time afterwards
present themselves, let them always keep in memory our blessed Saviour's
description of the particulars by which every man is to be judged at the
last day, where there is no mention made of inward feelings, possessions,
and the like; but <em>if he was hungry, ye gave him meat</em>," etc. (Matt. xxv
34-40).</p></blockquote>

<p>This was odd theology; but let it pass. There can be
no doubt that the circulation of this well-printed, if not
well-written, pamphlet created a prejudice against the young
preacher; and that this, in connection with the other circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
already mentioned, is quite sufficient to account for
the surprising fact, that whereas, at the end of the year 1737,
Whitefield, of all the preachers in the London churches, was
the most popular, he was, notwithstanding this, almost
universally tabooed at the end of 1738, and, with few
exceptions, found all the churches closed against him.</p>

<p>To an aspiring, ardent spirit, like that of Whitefield,
this was a serious trial; but while it pained, it failed to
paralyse the man. To gag him was impossible. If not
allowed to preach in churches, he was determined to preach
elsewhere. On Christmas Eve, besides preaching twice in
places not named, he attended a meeting of the Crooked
Lane Society, and "withstood several persons, who cavilled
against the doctrine of the new birth;" thence he "went and
expounded to a company at Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;'s, in Little Britain;"
and thence proceeded to a Moravian love-feast at Fetter Lane,
where he "continued, with many truly Christian brethren,
in prayer, psalms, and thanksgiving," till nearly four o'clock
on Christmas Day morning. But even now his work was
not ended. Instead of seeking rest in bed, he went direct
from Fetter Lane to Redcross Street, and, at four o'clock,
"expounded to another Society consisting of two or three
hundred people;"<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> at six, he expounded again "as well as
he could" to Crutched Friar's Society; and then, during
the same day, "without going to sleep," "preached thrice,
and assisted in administering the Christian Sacrament."
Thus, in something like six-and-thirty hours, he preached
five sermons, expounded to four Societies, and attended the
exhaustingly prolonged love-feast in Fetter Lane.</p>

<p>How did he spend the ensuing week,&mdash;the last in the
memorable year 1738? Many a man, after such exertions,
would have deemed it his duty to have had a Christmas
holiday; but if any one could truthfully sing the lines of
his friend Wesley, Whitefield could:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"Labour is rest, and pain is sweet,<br />
If Thou, my God, art here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>
<p>The question just propounded shall be answered partly
by Charles Wesley, and partly by Whitefield himself. The
former writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1738, Tuesday, December 26. George Whitefield preached. We
had the sacrament this and the four following days. On Thursday, my
brother preached; on Friday, George Whitefield; and on Saturday, Mr.
Robson. The whole week was a festival indeed; a joyful season, holy
unto the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1738, Saturday, December 30. Preached nine times this week, and
expounded near eighteen times, with great power and enlargement.
Blessed be God! I am every moment employed from morning till midnight.
There is no end of the people's coming and sending to me. They
seem more and more desirous, like new-born babes, to be fed with the
sincere milk of the word. What a great work has been wrought in the
hearts of many within this twelvemonth!</p>

<p>"Sunday, December 31. Preached twice to large congregations, especially
in the afternoon, at Spitalfields. I had a great hoarseness upon
me;" (no wonder!) "but God strengthened me to speak, so as to be
heard by all. After I left Spitalfields, I expounded to two companies in
Southwark, and was never more enlarged in prayer in my life. Many
were pricked to the heart, and <em>felt</em> themselves to be sinners. Oh that all
the world knew and felt that!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, with Whitefield, ended the year 1738.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">&nbsp;</a></span></p>




<h2><em>COMMENCEMENT OF OUTDOOR PREACHING.</em></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">January to August, 1739.</span></h3>


<p>Whitefield began the new year as gloriously as
he ended that which had just expired. He received
the sacrament, preached twice, expounded twice, attended a
Moravian love-feast in Fetter Lane, where he "spent the
<em>whole</em> night in prayer, psalms, and thanksgivings;" and then
pronounced "this to be the happiest New Year's Day he
had ever seen."</p>

<p>The love-feast at Fetter Lane was a memorable one.
Besides about sixty Moravians, there were present not fewer
than seven of the Oxford Methodists, namely, John and
Charles Wesley, George Whitefield, Westley Hall, Benjamin
Ingham, Charles Kinchin, and Richard Hutchins,&mdash;all of
them ordained clergymen of the Church of England. Wesley
writes: "About three in the morning, as we were continuing
instant in prayer, the power of God came mightily upon us,
insomuch that many cried out for exceeding joy, and many
fell to the ground. As soon as we were recovered a little
from that awe and amazement at the presence of His majesty,
we broke out with one voice, 'We praise Thee, O God; we
acknowledge Thee to be the Lord.'" This Pentecost on
New Year's Day could never be forgotten. It was a
glorious preparation for the herculean work on which
Whitefield and the Wesleys were about to enter. No
wonder that the year thus begun should be the most remarkable
in Methodistic history.</p>

<p>Only four hours after this overwhelming visitation in
Fetter Lane, Whitefield was employed in another kind of
work. He writes: "January 2. From seven in the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
till three in the afternoon, people came, some telling me
what God had done for their souls, and others crying out,
'What shall we do to be saved?'"</p>

<p>Three days afterwards, the seven Oxford Methodists, just
mentioned, "held a Conference at Islington, concerning
several things of great importance." Whitefield says: "What
we were in doubt about, after prayer, we determined by lot,
and everything else was carried on with great love, meekness,
and devotion. We continued in fasting and prayer
till three o'clock, and then parted with a full conviction that
God was going to do great things among us."</p>

<p>With the exception of the question whether Charles
Wesley ought "to settle at Oxford,"<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> the matters, which
were discussed at this the <em>first</em> Methodist Conference, are
utterly unknown; but that the members of it were intensely
earnest, and that their conviction that something marvellous
was about to happen was not the whim of presumptuous
fanatics, no one can seriously doubt.</p>

<p>During this momentous week&mdash;the first in the year 1739&mdash;Whitefield
preached six times, and expounded twice or
thrice every night. On the first Sunday of the year, January
7, he preached twice, expounded to three Societies, and
spent the <em>whole</em> night in prayer and thanksgiving at Fetter
Lane. The next day he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Monday, January 8. Though I sat up all night, yet God carried me
through the work of the day with about an hour's sleep. Expounded in
the evening, and confuted a virulent opposer of the doctrine of the new
birth, and justification by faith only. Spent the remainder of the evening
with our Bands, which are little combinations of six or more Christians
meeting together to compare their experiences."</p></blockquote>

<p>From such extracts, the reader may learn, 1. That Whitefield's
labours were gigantic. 2. That he had now fully embraced
the doctrine of justification by faith only. 3. That
he was in close communion with the Religious Societies, and
especially with the Moravian brotherhood.</p>

<p>Though most of the London churches were closed against
him, he was enormously popular, and his preaching more
powerful than ever. On January 10, after his sermon at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Great St. Helen's, £33 were collected towards erecting a
church for the Saltzburghers in Georgia; and he himself
testifies, concerning his ministry in general, "The Holy
Ghost so powerfully worked upon my hearers, pricking their
hearts, and melting them into floods of tears, that a spiritual
man said, 'He never saw the like before.'"</p>

<p>The time had now arrived for Whitefield to be ordained
a priest. Soon after his arrival from Georgia, he wrote as
follows, to his friend Harris at Gloucester:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>December 30, 1738</em>.
</p>

<p>"I am appointed by the Trustees to be minister of Savannah. The
Bishop of London (Doctor Gibson) accepts the title, and has given me
letters demissory to any other bishop. I have waited also on Doctor
Secker, Bishop of Oxford, who acquaints me that our worthy diocesan,
good Bishop Benson, ordains for him to-morrow fortnight at Oxford, and
that he will give me letters demissory to him. God be praised! I was
praying night and day, whilst on ship-board, that good Bishop Benson,
who laid hands on me as a deacon, might now make me a priest. And
now my prayer is answered."</p></blockquote>

<p>In accordance with this arrangement, Whitefield, on
January the 10th, set out for Oxford, where he spent the
next four days. His Journal of this brief interval is too
racy to be omitted. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Friday, January 12. Breakfasted with sixteen or seventeen Christian
brethren; expounded and read prayers at the Castle to many devout souls.
Afterwards, I waited on the Bishop of Gloucester, who received me very
kindly. Waited on the Master of Pembroke; afterwards on the archdeacon.
Went to public worship at Pembroke. Supped, prayed, and
sung psalms, with a room full of brethren at Mr. F&mdash;&mdash;'s;<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> then adjourned
to Corpus Christi College, where God assisted me to talk clearly of the
new birth, and justification by faith alone, with one that opposed it.</p>

<p>"Saturday, January 13. Received the holy sacrament at St. Mary's;
expounded at F&mdash;&mdash;'s; went with the other candidates for holy orders to
subscribe to the Articles, and secretly prayed that we all might have our
names written in the book of life. Drank tea with a well-disposed gentleman
commoner, and had close conversation with many others at Corpus
Christi College.</p>

<p>Sunday, January 14. This, blessed be God, has been a day of fat
things. Rose in the morning, and prayed and sung psalms lustily, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
with a good courage; and afterwards was ordained priest at Christ's
Church. <em>Before</em>, I was a little dissipated, but, <em>at</em> imposition of hands,
my mind was in an humble frame, and I received grace in the holy
sacrament. That I might begin to make proof of my ministry, I preached
and administered the sacrament at the Castle; and preached in the
afternoon at St. Alban's, to a crowded congregation. The church was
surrounded by gownsmen of all degrees, who stood attentive at the windows
during my sermon. God enabled me to preach with the demonstration
of the Spirit, and with power, and quite took away my hoarseness, so
that I could lift up my voice like a trumpet. After sermon, I joined in
giving thanks to our good God for all the mercies He had conferred upon
me. Then I read prayers at Carfax; expounded to a large and devout
company at a private house; and spent the remainder of the evening with
thirteen more, where God gave me great cheerfulness of spirit."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield was ordained a priest. It is more than possible,
if he had waited until the next Ember-days, he would
never have been ordained a priest at all. Bishop Benson,
from the first, had been a friend to him. Though he had
publicly declared he would not ordain any one a deacon
under the age of three-and-twenty, he, without solicitation,
ordained Whitefield when he was only twenty-one years and
a half. He gave him five guineas to assist him in defraying
the expenses of taking his B.A. degree at Oxford, and
twenty pounds for the poor of Georgia. He ordained him
a priest when, with few exceptions, the clergy of the land
were beginning to indulge in clamorous complaints against
him; and, three weeks after his ordination, gave him another
"liberal benefaction for Georgia."<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> And yet, even "the <em>good
bishop</em>," as Whitefield so often calls him, was not absolutely
contented with him. Hence the following extract from a
letter addressed to the Earl of Huntingdon. After giving
an account of Whitefield's ordination, the bishop proceeds
to say:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I hope this will give some satisfaction to my lady, and that she will
not have occasion to find fault with your lordship's old tutor. <em>Though
mistaken on some points</em>, I think Mr. Whitefield a very pious, well-meaning
young man, with good abilities and great zeal. I find his Grace of Canterbury<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
thinks highly of him. I pray God to grant him great success in all
his undertakings for the good of mankind, and the revival of true religion
and holiness among us in these degenerate days; in which prayer, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
sure, your lordship and my kind good Lady Huntington will most heartily
join."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This letter introduces a name which will occupy a prominent
place throughout the whole of Whitefield's remaining
history. When and where the Countess of Huntingdon first
became acquainted with Whitefield we are not informed; but
it is evident that already she was interested in the man, and
desirous of his ordination. Her well-informed biographer,
in his "Life and Times of Selina, Countess of Huntingdon,"
has crowded his pages with facts, racy, rich, and important;
but he sorely tries the patience of his readers by his neglect
of dates, and by his consequent chronological confusion. He
states, however, that, among the nobility, Lady Townshend,
the eccentric mother of George, the first Marquis Townshend,
"was the first who extolled the preaching of Whitefield,
whom she alternately liked and disliked."<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>Further, one of the earliest fruits of Whitefield's ministry
among the nobility in the metropolis was Lady Anne
Frankland, daughter of the Earl of Scarborough, and second
wife of Frederick Frankland, Esq., M.P. for Thirsk. For
many years, Lady Anne held the situation of Lady of the
Bedchamber to the Princess Anne, and to the Princesses
Amelia and Caroline. By the influence of Lady Frankland,
her sisters, the Lady Barbara Leigh and the Lady Henrietta
Lumley, were induced to attend Whitefield's preaching, from
which they received much spiritual good. This so exasperated
Mr. Frankland, that he treated his wife with the utmost
cruelty, declared she was the object of his aversion, and
threatened to murder her. The result was, a separation
followed, and, not long afterwards, Lady Frankland died.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>
<p>The Earl of Huntingdon and his illustrious wife constantly
attended wherever Whitefield preached. Among others
whom, at this early period, the Countess of Huntingdon
interested in Whitefield's remarkable career, was Sarah,
Duchess of Marlborough, famed for her beauty, dignity,
sprightliness, wit, petulance, pride, and vanity, and of whom
it has been said that, by her influence in the Cabinet, she
swayed the destinies of Europe with as great effect as did
her husband, by his talents, in the field. The great duchess
wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My dear Lady Huntingdon is always so very good to me, that I must
accept your very obliging invitation to accompany you to hear Mr.
Whitefield. I do hope that I shall be all the better for all your excellent
advice. God knows we all need mending, and none more than myself.
I have lived to see great changes in the world, have acted a conspicuous
part myself, and now hope, in my old days,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> to obtain mercy from God, as
I never expect any at the hands of my fellow-creatures. The Duchess of
Ancaster, Lady Townshend, and Lady Cobham were exceedingly pleased
with many observations in Mr. Whitefield's sermon at St. Sepulchre's
Church, which has made me lament ever since that I did not hear it, as
it might have been the means of doing me some good; <em>for good, alas!
I do want</em>, but where among the corrupt sons and daughters of Adam am
I to find it?"<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Another aristocratic lady, who, in these early days of
Methodism, attended the preaching of Whitefield and the
Wesleys, was the proud Duchess of Buckingham, a natural
daughter of King James the Second, whose first husband was
the Earl of Anglesey (from whom she was divorced), and
her second, John Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham, in whose
house (now Buckingham Palace) she died, in 1742. This
quasi-royal duchess heard the Methodists, but disliked their
doctrines. Writing to the Countess of Huntingdon, she
said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I thank your ladyship for the information concerning the Methodist
preachers. Their doctrines are most repulsive, and strongly tinctured
with impertinence and disrespect towards their superiors, in perpetually
endeavouring to level all ranks, and do away with all distinctions. It is
monstrous to be told that you have a heart as sinful as the common
wretches that crawl on the earth. This is highly offensive and insulting;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and I cannot but wonder that your ladyship should relish any sentiments
so much at variance with high rank and good breeding. However, I shall
be most happy to accept your kind offer of accompanying me to hear your
favourite preacher, and shall wait your arrival. The Duchess of Queensbury
insists on my patronising her on this occasion; consequently, she
will be an <em>addition</em> to our party."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Duchess of Queensbury, to whom allusion has
just been made, was the second daughter of the Earl of
Clarendon, and was celebrated for extraordinary beauty,
humour, and vivacity, by Pope, Swift, and other poets,
particularly by Prior, in one of his well-known ballads. For
a time, she constantly attended the ministry of Whitefield
and his brother Methodists, and was specially partial to the
preaching of Charles Wesley and Benjamin Ingham.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Other distinguished hearers might be mentioned. Lady
Lisburne, for example, was a frequent attendant on the
preaching of the first Methodists, and was roused, by their
powerful ministry, to a lively concern for eternal things.
Also, Lady Hinchinbroke, grand-daughter of the Duke of
Montague, and mother of the celebrated John George
Montague, fourth Earl of Sandwich. This noble lady was
deeply affected by the sermons of Whitefield and Wesley,
and wrote as follows to the Countess of Huntingdon:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am extremely sensible of the honour your ladyship has done me by
the book which you have sent. Indeed, I stand in need of all your sympathy
and all your unwearied exertions; for I feel myself utterly helpless,
miserable, and guilty in the sight of heaven; and, were it not for the ray
of hope which I have in the atoning sacrifice of Christ, would be driven to
despair and ruin. Have you heard where Mr. Whitefield and Mr. Wesley
are to preach this week?"<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But, leaving his aristocratic hearers, it is time to return to
Whitefield himself. On the day after his ordination at
Oxford, he came back to London, where he spent the next
three weeks. An immense amount of work was thrust into
this brief interval. He gave Charles Wesley "so promising
an account of Oxford," that Charles felt "strongly inclined"
to settle there, as he had been urged to do at the recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
held conference of Oxford Methodists.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> He transacted
business with the Trustees of Georgia, who presented him
to the living of Savannah, and granted him five hundred
acres of land for his projected Orphan House. He was frequent
in his attendance at the Moravian meetings in Fetter
Lane, "where," says he, "we sometimes spent whole nights
in prayer, and where I have often seen the people overwhelmed
with the Divine Presence, and crying out, 'Will
God indeed dwell with men upon earth?'" He spent an
"afternoon <em>in visiting some Dissenting brethren, who were
Christians indeed</em>,"&mdash;an act of courtesy which his friend
Wesley carefully avoided. He went even to Stoke Newington,
to have an interview with the arch-Dissenter of the
day&mdash;the celebrated Dr. Watts&mdash;who, though in great
debility and suffering, was actively employed in publishing
a pamphlet on one of the most debateable of topics, "Civil
Power in Things Sacred."<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> During his three weeks' stay in
London, Whitefield preached more than twenty times, and
expounded almost fifty. He began to make collections for
his Orphan House in Georgia. He had a long conference
with an opposing clergyman, who objected to private
Societies and extempore prayer, grounding his objection on
the authority of the Canons and the Act of Uniformity.
Whitefield replied that the Canons and the Act of Uniformity
referred to <em>public worship only</em>, whereas that of the
Societies was <em>not public worship</em>, but only "an imitation of the
primitive Christians, who continued daily with one accord in
the <em>temple</em>, and yet exhorted one another <em>from house to house</em>."
He had another conference, which lasted till after midnight,
with two Church of England clergymen, who were "strong
opposers of the doctrine of the new birth." Whitefield says,
"God enabled me, with great simplicity, to declare what He
had done for my soul, which made them look upon me as a
madman." Besides his work in London, Whitefield went to
Bexley, where he preached, and spent two delightful evenings
with the Delamottes. He also went to Gravesend,
where he preached in the churches twice, and in private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
houses expounded thrice; his journey there and back being
performed by boat on the river Thames&mdash;a six hours' sail in
the depth of winter, begun from London at three o'clock in
the morning, and from Gravesend at eleven o'clock at night.
The churches in London that he was allowed to occupy
were: St. Helen's in Bishopsgate Street, where his friend
Broughton was minister; Christ Church, in Spitalfields; St.
Catherine's; Islington; Wapping; St. George's-in-the-East;
and St. Margaret's, Westminster.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I sleep but little, very little," said he, in a letter dated January 27,
1739. "Had I a thousand hands, I could employ them all. I scare know
what it is to have an idle moment. I thank you for blessing God on my
behalf. I want a thousand tongues to praise Him. He still works by me
more and more. Subscriptions for erecting an orphan house come in
apace. On Monday seven-night, God willing, I set out for Bristol, with
Mr. Seward. Mr. Howel Harris and I are correspondents, blessed be
God! May I follow him as he does Jesus Christ! How he outstrips
me!"</p></blockquote>

<p>As Messrs. Seward and Harris will occupy a somewhat
prominent position in the ensuing pages, a brief account of
them may be acceptable.</p>

<p>William Seward, together with his brothers, Thomas,
Benjamin, and Henry, were natives of Badsey, a hamlet
about two and a half miles from Evesham, and were men of
independent property. Thomas was a clergyman of the
Church of England, and will be mentioned hereafter. Little
is known respecting Benjamin, excepting that he spent some
years at Cambridge, was unimpeachable in his morals, was
converted in the spring of 1739,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and occasionally employed
himself in composing hymns. The following was appended
to an 8vo. pamphlet, published in the year of his conversion,
and entitled "The Conduct and Doctrine of the Rev. Mr.
Whitefield vindicated." Though lacking poetic merit, it is
not without interest as exhibiting the spirit of one of Whitefield's
great admirers:&mdash;</p>

<p>Henry Seward, the eldest of the brothers, was married
to a Baptist wife, and was, as will be seen, a violent opposer
of the Methodists.</p>

<p>William was drawn to seek after God and serve Him
as early as the year 1728. He laboured hard and successfully
in reviving the charity schools in London, particularly
those in Langbourn Ward, Castle Baynard Ward,
Billingsgate Ward, Vintry Ward, in the parish of St. George
the Martyr, and in Hackney. For the school at the last-mentioned
place, he raised, by subscriptions and public collections,
an income of £150 per annum, and that notwithstanding
the "opposition of the minister, the churchwardens,
and the vestrymen of the parish."<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1738, he became acquainted with Charles
Wesley and the Methodists, and, in the month of November,
found peace with God through faith in Christ. Oddly
enough, he was allowed to be present at the Conference
of Oxford Methodists, already mentioned, on January<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
5, 1739.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> A few weeks afterwards, he became Whitefield's
travelling companion; and went with him to America in
August, 1739.</p>

<p>William Seward returned to England, not to stay in it, but,
1. To induce Mr. Hutchins, the Oxford Methodist, to take
the management of Whitefield's Orphan House in Georgia.
2. To convince the Trustees of Georgia that three things were
necessary to establish the Colony, viz.: "an allowance of
negroes, a free title to the lands, and an independent
magistracy." 3. To collect subscriptions for a negro school
in Pennsylvania. And, 4. To bring the money, lodged in the
hands of the trustees, for building the church at Savannah.</p>

<p>These were the public reasons why Mr. Seward returned
to England; but there were also private reasons. Mr. Seward
had bought five thousand acres of land on the forks of
Delaware, for which he had paid £2,200 sterling; and he
hoped to beg this amount of money in England, and then to
give the land for the erection of a negro school, and also a
location for a number of "English friends, where," to use
Seward's words, "they might worship God in their own
way, without being thought <em>Enthusiasts</em> for so doing."
He also intended to buy a ship in England for the purpose
of conveying the refugees to their foreign home.
The place was to be a sort of "Hernhuth" in America.
Besides this, William Seward seems to have been a widower
with an only daughter, who was being educated by a
private governess. He was now desirous to remove his
daughter to Georgia, and to complete her education in
Whitefield's Orphan House. With reference to this, he
wished to buy of the Trustees of Georgia five hundred acres
of land adjoining the Orphan House estate, provided he
could have a perfect title to leave it to the Orphan House, if
he thought desirable.</p>

<p>From this concise statement it will be seen that Mr.
Seward had abundance of business to transact in England;
but besides all this, there was a family quarrel exceedingly
unpleasant. The elder brother, Henry Seward, was wroth
at his brothers becoming Methodists. Three months before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
William's return to England, Benjamin Seward was seriously
ill. "His fever was called madness." His letters were intercepted,
and his servants set over him as spies. Charles
Wesley went to see him, but was not admitted to his presence,
and wrote:&mdash;"Henry Seward fell upon me without
preface or ceremony. I was the downfall of his brother,
had picked his pocket, ruined his family, come now to get
more money, was a scoundrel, rascal, and so forth, and
deserved to have my gown stripped over my ears. He concluded
with threatening how he would beat me, if he could
but catch me on Bengeworth Common." On the day after
this angry interview, Charles Wesley attempted to preach.
Henry Seward came and said, "Four constables are ordered
to apprehend you if you come near my brother's wall," the
place appointed for preaching; "so come at your peril."
Charles writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I walked towards the place. Mr. Henry met me with threats and
revilings. I began singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Shall I, for fear of feeble man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy Spirit's course in me restrain?'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He ran about raving like a madman, and quickly got some men for his
purpose, who laid hold on me. Henry cried, 'Take him away, and duck
him.' I broke out into singing with T. Maxfield, and let them carry me
whither they would. At the bridge in the lane, they left me. There I
stood out of the liberty of the corporation, and gave out&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Angel of God, whate'er betide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy summons I obey!'"<br /></span>
</div></div></blockquote>

<p>Charles then proceeded to preach to a congregation of
some hundreds, from the words, "If God be for us, who can
be against us?"</p>

<p>Eight days after this, Charles Wesley and Henry Seward
had another altercation. The country squire again lost his
manners, and after calling the poor Methodist preacher,
"rogue, rascal, villain, and pickpocket," actually wrung his
nose. Charles departed, rejoicing that he was counted
worthy to suffer shame in the cause of Christ.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Three months after this disreputable scene, William Seward
arrived in England, and most likely visited his brothers at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Badsey. Be that as it may, when William and Charles
Wesley met at Bristol, in the month of September following,
William was evidently prejudiced against his friend. Charles
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1740, September 23. Mr. W. Seward came, and was very cordial. We
prayed, rejoiced, and gave thanks. If I did not love him the better for his
opinion, I am sure it made me more industrious to confirm my old love
towards him. I carried him to our colliers. He spoke a few words to
them, which did not convince me of his call to preach. In our return, he
told me Mrs. Grevil and others had urged him to claim the Room in the
Horse-fair,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> but he abhorred their baseness. Next day, he told me he was
in a mist, the Baptists last night having laboured hard to make him
oppose me publicly. Before we parted, all was set right again; but a few
hours after, he came from the Baptists, and utterly renounced both me
and my brother, in bitter words of hatred, which they had put into his
mouth."<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>William Seward's work was nearly ended. Immediately
after this painful interview in Bristol, he proceeded to Wales,
where he joined Howell Harris, and met with most brutal
treatment. At Caerleon, where he preached, he was "pelted
with dung and dirt, eggs and plumbstones." Some hard
substance hit him on the eye, the result of the blow being a
total loss of sight. But even this was not the worst. At
Hay, a man struck him so severely on the head, that, a few
days afterwards, on October 22, 1740,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> his life was ended at
the early age of thirty-eight. On hearing of his death,
Wesley wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1740, October 27. The surprising news of poor Mr. Seward's death
was confirmed. Surely God will maintain His own cause. Righteous art
Thou, O Lord!"</p></blockquote>

<p>On the same occasion, Charles Wesley wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1740, October 28. I was exceedingly shocked with the news of Mr.
Seward's death; but he is taken from the evil; rescued out of the hands of
wicked men."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a long account of Seward and his brothers; but
their names have always been so prominent in the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
career of Whitefield and the Wesleys, that the writer hopes
to be forgiven for collecting the hitherto scattered scraps of
information concerning them, and presenting that information
in a connected form.</p>

<p>After William Seward's death, his brothers are never mentioned
in Methodistic annals.</p>

<p>The account of Howell Harris shall be shorter. It is
taken from a document written by himself. This memorable
Welshman was born at Trevecka, on January 23, 1714, and
was, therefore, a few months older than his friend Whitefield.
In 1732, when his father died, Harris took charge
of a country school. In 1735, he found peace with God,
through faith in Jesus Christ. Converted himself, he had an
intense desire to convert others. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Swearing, lying, reviling, drunkenness, fighting, and gaming overspread
the country. Ministers were not in earnest, and their instructions,
delivered in an unfeeling and indifferent manner, seemed to have no effect
upon their hearers. I could not help making it my business to speak to
all I came near of their danger. Death and judgment, and the necessity
of praying and receiving the sacrament, were the principal subjects of my
conversation. I set up family worship in my mother's house, and on
Sunday mornings some of the neighbours would come to hear me read the
lessons and psalms, etc."</p></blockquote>

<p>He proceeds to relate how he also commenced meetings
on Sunday evenings, and exhorted the poor people who
flocked to hear him. "Thus," he says, "I spent that summer,
1735."</p>

<p>In November following, he relinquished his school, and
entered himself at St. Mary's Hall, Oxford; but the "irregularities
and immoralities which surrounded" him were such,
that he kept only a single term, and returned to Wales. He
again set up a school at Trevecka. He visited from house
to house, until he had visited the greatest part of his native
parish. His congregation increased, and the houses in which
they met could not contain them. Many of his hearers
became penitent, and cried to God for the pardon of their
sins. Family worship in numerous instances was begun.
The churches were soon crowded, and likewise the Lord's
table. Then persecution arose. The magistrates threatened
him with fines for holding meetings in private houses. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
clergy did their utmost to discourage him, and, at the end of
the year 1737, expelled him from his school.</p>

<p>Up to the present, in the day-time he had taught his
scholars, and at night had held meetings. Now he had both
days and nights at his disposal, and preached to crowded
congregations thirty or forty times every week. The magistrates
threatened him more furiously than ever; and the
clergy preached against him, and branded him as a deceiver;
but, in several counties, a general reformation was witnessed.
Public diversions became unfashionable, and religion became
the common talk. Places of worship were everywhere
thronged, and, in many places, Societies were set up. The
Rev. Griffith Jones began his charity schools. The Rev.
Daniel Rowlands and some other young clergymen began to
preach in the same extemporary manner as Harris did.
The work grew, and so also did the persecution. In Montgomeryshire,
"a knight, a clergyman, two justices, a constable,
and a mob," came while Harris was preaching, and
charged him with a breach of the Conventicle Act. The
preacher told the magistrates that he was a Conformist, and
therefore not subject to the penalties of the Act in question.
At Machynlleth he was surrounded by a mob, "threatening,
swearing, and flinging stones," the leaders of the gang being
a clergyman and a lawyer. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"By the trials through which I often passed, I was at length so accustomed
to them that I was daily in expectation of them. I became more
acquainted with the world and myself, and could attest the truth of that
expression which at first seems harsh, 'Man is a mixture of beast and
devil.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, that, up to this date, Howell Harris
had never seen either Whitefield or the Wesleys. Whitefield,
on his return from Georgia, heard that the young
evangelist, without episcopal ordination or any sort of
ecclesiastical authority whatever, was preaching in the towns
and villages of Wales thirty or forty times every week; and,
notwithstanding the opposition and the violence of clergymen,
magistrates, and mobs, had already been the means of
accomplishing a marvellous reformation. The results were
quite sufficient to constrain Whitefield to recognize the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Welsh itinerant as a fellow-labourer in the same great work.
Hence, only a few days after his arrival in England, Whitefield
wrote to Howell Harris as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>December 20, 1738</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,&mdash;Though I am unknown to you in person, I
have long been united to you in spirit, and have been rejoiced to hear how
the good pleasure of the Lord prospered in your hand. Go on, my dear
brother, go on. Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might.
There have been, and will be, many adversaries; but be not afraid. He
who sent you will assist, comfort, and protect you, and make you more
than conqueror through His great love. I am a living monument of this,
for the Divine strength has often been magnified in my weakness. I have
tasted that the Lord is gracious; I have felt His power; and, from experience,
can say that, in doing or suffering the will of Jesus Christ, there is
great reward.</p>

<p>"Blessed be His holy name! There seems to be a great pouring out
of the Spirit in London, and we walk in the comfort of the Holy Ghost,
and are edified.</p>

<p>"You see, my dear Brother, the freedom I have taken in writing to
you. If you would favour me with a line or two, by way of answer, you
would greatly rejoice both me and many others. Why should we not tell
one another what God has done for our souls?</p>

<p>"My dear Brother, I love you in the bowels of Jesus Christ, and wish
you may be the spiritual father of thousands, and shine, as the sun in the
firmament, in the kingdom of your heavenly Father.</p>

<p class="sig">
"Your affectionate, though unworthy brother in Christ,<br />
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was Whitefield's warm-hearted salutation to the
young lay-preacher in the principality of Wales. Harris's
reply was equally cordial. The following is an extract from
it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Glamorgan</span>, <em>January 8, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,&mdash;I was most agreeably surprised last night by a
letter from you. Though this is the first time of our correspondence, I am
no stranger to you. When I first heard of your labours and success, my
soul was united to you, and engaged to send addresses to heaven on your
behalf. When I read your Diary, I had uncommon influence of the Divine
Presence shining on my soul almost continually, but I little thought our
good Lord and Master intended I should ever see your handwriting.</p>

<p>Oh how ravishing it is to hear of such demonstrations of the Divine love
and favour to London! And, to make your joy greater still, I have some
good news to send you from Wales. There is a great revival in Cardiganshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
through Mr. D. Rowlands, a Church minister, who has been
much owned and blessed in Carmarthenshire also. We have also a sweet
prospect in Breckonshire and part of Monmouthshire. And the revival
prospers in this county where I am now. There is also here a very useful
young dissenting minister, who is a man of great charity. There is
another of the same character in Montgomeryshire. There are two or
three young curates in Glamorganshire, who are well-wishers to the cause
of God; and we have an exceedingly valuable clergyman in Breckonshire.
But enemies are many and powerful. Oh that I had more love in my soul,
more humble zeal, and spiritual boldness!"<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
</p></blockquote>



<p>After this long but not useless digression, it is time to
return to Whitefield.</p>

<p>He was detained in England much longer than he expected,
but he was not unmindful of his flock in Georgia.
In a letter "to the inhabitants of Savannah," dated January
19, 1739, he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You are upon my heart, so that I am ready to live and die with you.
As soon as my affairs are finished in England, I shall return to you. The
trustees have now appointed me minister of Savannah, and granted
all I desired of them, so that I have nothing to do but to watch over
your souls, that I may present you blameless at the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ. Be steadfast, therefore, my brethren, be unmoveable. Carefully
attend to the words spoken by your present pastor. Let love be
without dissimulation. Let not slander so much as be named amongst
you, as becometh saints. Be not slothful in business, yet take heed that
you are fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. Pray without ceasing; in
everything give thanks; and assure yourselves you are continually remembered
by your most affectionate pastor,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."<a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Before leaving for the West of England, Whitefield's last
Sunday in London was a memorable one. He shall relate
his own story.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1739. Sunday, February 4. Preached in the morning at St. George's
in the East; collected £18 for the Orphan House; and had, I believe, six
hundred communicants, which highly offended the officiating curate.
Preached again at Christ Church, Spitalfields; and gave thanks and sang
psalms at a private house. Went thence to St. Margaret's Westminster;
but, something breaking belonging to the coach, could not get thither till
the middle of the prayers. Went through the people to the minister's
pew, but, finding it locked, I returned to the vestry till the sexton could be
found. Being there informed that another minister intended to preach,
I desired several times that I might go home. My friends would by no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
means consent, telling me I was appointed by the trustees to preach; and
that, if I did not, the people would go out of the church. At my request,
some went to the trustees, churchwardens, and minister; and, whilst I
was waiting for an answer, and the last psalm was being sung, a man
came, with a wand in his hand, whom I took for the proper church officer,
and told me I was to preach. I, not doubting but the minister was satisfied,
followed him to the pulpit, and God enabled me to preach with
greater power than I had done all the day before.</p>

<p>"After this, I prayed with and gave an exhortation to a company that
waited for me. Then I went to Fetter Lane, where I spent the whole
night in watching unto prayer, and discussing several important points
with many truly Christian friends. About four in the morning, we went
all together, and broke bread at a poor sick sister's room; and so we parted,
I hope, in a spirit not unlike that of the primitive Christians."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is soon related, but the service at St. Margaret's
must have further notice. It engendered a rancorous controversy,
which cannot, in fairness, be omitted.</p>

<p>In a long leading article in the <cite>Weekly Miscellany</cite> of
February 10, 1739, the following account was published:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On Sunday last, our new <em>Methodists</em> discovered a more violent temper
than is consistent with their great pretensions to <em>meekness</em> and <em>sanctity</em>.
The story is as follows, and it was related to me by the gentleman that
read the prayers:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At St. Margaret's, Westminster, there is a <em>Society</em> Evening Lecture;
and when the Reader came, he found in the <em>churchyard</em>, at the <em>west door</em>,
a number of people singing psalms. When he got into the <em>church</em>, he
was affronted by some unknown persons as he passed through a great
crowd to the vestry. As soon as the clergyman appointed to <em>preach</em> came,
he was <em>solicited</em> (if an <em>overbearing importunity</em> may be so called) to resign
the pulpit to Mr. Whitefield, who (as is supposed by his not appearing at
the <em>prayers</em>) was waiting at some neighbouring house to know the issue of
their application. But the <em>preacher</em> continuing as determined to do his
duty as Mr. Whitefield was to do it for him, they at last effected that by
<em>force</em> which they could not gain by <em>treaty</em>. So the <em>preacher</em> was safely
confined in his <em>pew</em>, which was locked (the sexton being appointed by the
<em>Society</em>, and in Mr. Whitefield's interest), and guarded by several lusty
fellows; while another party conveyed the <em>unlicensed intruder</em> triumphantly
up into the pulpit, and kept sentry on the stairs for fear he should be
taken down in as forcible a manner as he got up."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Venn, the writer of this account, then adds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There are many instances of these <em>unauthorised</em> teachers using
<em>fraudulent</em> and <em>unfair</em> means of getting into pulpits against the inclination
of the <em>proper minister</em> or <em>appointed preacher</em>. Sometimes they ask the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
pulpit for a <em>friend</em>, and then send Mr. Whitefield or some other <em>Methodist</em>.
Another method has been by slipping up into the pulpit as soon as the
prayers are over, without asking any leave at all. And all these <em>disorders</em>,
<em>irregularities</em>, and <em>artifices</em> are practised by persons who have no <em>warrant</em>,
but <em>their pretended call from heaven</em>, to preach in <em>any</em> church in the
diocese."</p></blockquote>

<p>The reader has thus before him the two conflicting statements.
A fortnight afterwards, in the same newspaper, Mr.
Bennett, one of the stewards of the Society, whose evening
lecture at St. Margaret's had caused so much uproar, declared
that the simple facts were these:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On Sunday, February 4, Mr. Whitefield, at the desire of the Friendly
Society, came from Spitalfields Church to St. Margaret's, of Westminster.
He would have gone into the minister's seat, but could not, there being no
one to unlock the door. He then went into the vestry, and stayed there
during prayers. The usual preacher before the Society<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> was out of town,
otherwise they would have acquainted him with their desire of Mr. Whitefield
preaching, which they doubt not but he would have complied with.
That he had desired another to preach, they knew not, when they asked
Mr. Whitefield to do it; but when he was come, in compliance with their
frequently repeated desire, they did insist upon his preaching."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Bennett adds, that all the rest of Mr. Venn's letter,
relating to the affront offered to the Reader of Prayers, the
Rev. Mr. Durant; the "<em>overbearing importunity</em>" brought to
bear upon the Rev. J. Majendie, the gentleman who had
promised to preach for the absent lecturer; the assumed
waiting of Whitefield in a neighbouring house; the employment
of the sexton in Whitefield's interest; the taking of
the pulpit by "force;" and the sentry of lusty fellows on
the pulpit stairs, were not facts, but fiction, created by the
writer's "own ingenuity, purely to heighten and embellish his
story."</p>

<p>Much more was printed respecting the St. Margaret's
fracas; but the case, in brief, was this: The Rev. Mr.
Morgan, the Lecturer, having to be out of town, asked the
Rev. J. Majendie to supply his place on February 4, at St.
Margaret's, and Mr. Majendie readily consented to do so.
Meanwhile, the officers of the Friendly Society, ascertaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
that their "usual lecturer" would be from home, and very
improperly taking it for granted that he had provided no one
to occupy the pulpit for him, rashly went to Whitefield, and
obtained from him a promise to preach in Mr. Morgan's
stead. When Whitefield found that Mr. Majendie was
present, as Mr. Morgan's properly engaged substitute, he
wished to retire, and would have done so, if, to use Mr.
Bennett's own expression, the officers of the Society had not
"<em>insisted upon his preaching</em>."</p>

<p>This is all that can be said about this disreputable brawling
in St. Margaret's. Mr. Morgan and Mr. Majendie were
blameless. Mr. Bennett and his friends were highly culpable
in setting aside the arrangement made by their absent
Lecturer; and Whitefield, when he had ascertained that Mr.
Majendie had come to preach, would have acted a more
courteous and less ignoble part, if, instead of taking Mr.
Morgan's pulpit, he had at once retired to the Moravian
Meeting House in Fetter Lane.</p>

<p>Some will think that more space has been devoted to this
unhappy affair than its importance merits; but those who
have had the perseverance to make themselves acquainted
with all the Methodist facts of the year 1739, will think
otherwise, as there can be no doubt that this unfortunate
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contretemps</i> in Westminster was the real or pretended occasion
of much of the clerical opposition which Whitefield
soon encountered in Bristol, Bath, and other places; and it
certainly was the beginning of the furious onslaughts upon
Methodism and the Methodists, which, for so many months,
disgraced the <cite>Weekly Miscellany</cite> and Dr. Hooker, its
trenchant editor. Several of these attacks will be noticed
hereafter; but one must be introduced now, inasmuch as its
date is nearly the same as that of the imbroglio at St.
Margaret's. In his leading article of February 10, 1739,
Mr. Hooker<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At first, we only looked upon the Methodists as well-meaning, zealous
people, whom the irreligious boldness of these wicked times had driven
somewhat too far into the contrary extreme of infidelity. They were a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
sort of Protestant supererogators, that would be righteous over-much;
and there were hopes that, when this devotional effervescence had boiled
over, they would return to that proper medium where true piety and Christian
prudence fix the centre. But, instead of that, they have proceeded so far
as to eject the <em>Liturgy</em> and the <em>usual Expositors</em> out of their meetings, and
have declared for <em>extemporary</em> effusions both in their <em>prayers</em> and <em>expoundings</em>.
The <em>laity</em> are allowed to be <em>teachers</em>, and even <em>women</em>, as I am
informed, begin to usurp public offices. They pretend to a sort of <em>sinless
perfection</em>, and boast of <em>inward joys</em> above other Christians. They distinguish
themselves from others by having <em>received the faith</em>, with which,
and other cant phrases, they are united together like a sect of <em>Religious
Freemasons</em>. In general, they seem to be practising over the lesson set
them by the <em>old Puritans</em> before the beginning of the <em>grand rebellion</em>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Three days after he preached at St. Margaret's, Whitefield,
accompanied by William Seward, set out for Bristol.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I never was more opposed," says he, "and never met with so great
success. I hope I shall learn more and more every day, that no place is
amiss for preaching the Gospel. God forbid that the word of God should
be bound because some deny the use of their churches! The more I am
bid to hold my peace, the more earnestly will I lift up my voice like a
trumpet, and tell the people what must be done in them before they can
be finally saved by Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Even while travelling, Whitefield could not refrain from
preaching. At Windsor, he "expounded in the school-house
to a great number of people with freedom and
power." At Basingstoke, he preached for an hour in a large
room thronged with people, while a mob outside shouted
and threw stones at the windows. The next day, three
large rooms were filled. Some began to interrupt: but
"God," says he, "enabled me to speak with such power that
they were quite struck dumb and confounded. Near twenty
came to converse with me, and to hear the word of God.
How thankful ought I to be to my dear Master for sending
me hither! A vestry, I find, was called to stop my proceedings,
and I hear I am to be presented to the Diocesan."</p>

<p>At Basingstoke, also, he wrote a letter to a friend, which
contains a paragraph too valuable to be omitted.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Basingstoke</span>, <em>February 8, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"Just now God has brought us to Basingstoke, where I hope an
effectual door will be opened before we leave. Oh, my dear friend, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and more do I see the benefit of confessing our blessed Lord before men.
He has begun, He will carry on, He will finish the good work in our
souls. We have nothing to do, but to lay hold on Him by faith, and to
depend on Him for wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.
Not but we must be workers together with Him; for a true faith in Jesus
Christ will not suffer us to be idle. No: it is an active, lively, restless
principle; it fills the heart, so that it cannot be easy till it is doing something
for Jesus Christ."</p></blockquote>

<p>At Dummer, the little parish where he once was curate,
Whitefield met his old Oxford friends, Messrs. Kinchin and
Hutchins, with whom he took sweet counsel, sung psalms,
and prayed.</p>

<p>At Salisbury, he writes, "I paid a visit to an old disciple,
my brother Wesley's mother," at that time visiting her son-in-law,
Westley Hall.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Here also he sought an interview
with the well-known sceptic, Thomas Chubb, resident in an
adjoining village, respecting his "True Gospel of Jesus
Christ asserted;" but the "free-thinker," (who, by the
way, regularly attended the services of his parish church,)
happened not to be at home.</p>

<p>On February 14th, Whitefield arrived at Bath, and immediately
waited upon Dr. C., desiring the use of the Abbey
Church, to preach a sermon for the Orphan House, the
Trustees of Georgia having obtained the consent of the
bishop more than twelve months before. "But," he writes,
"Dr. C. was pleased to give me an absolute refusal to
preach either on that or on any other occasion, without a
positive order from the king or bishop. I asked him his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
reasons. He said he was not obliged to give me any.
Upon which, I took my leave and retired with my friends,
and prayed for him most fervently." On the evening of the
same day, Whitefield came to Bristol, where his old friends
welcomed him with the utmost joy; but his chief pleasure,
on his arrival, was, not the greetings of his friends, but the
calumny of his enemies. He writes: "Who can express
the joy with which I was received? To add to my comfort,
many letters came to my hands from London friends. But
the chiefest pleasure was, some one had thought me considerable
enough to write a letter in the <cite>Weekly Miscellany</cite> against
me, and containing several untruths about my preaching at
St. Margaret's, Westminster. Thou shalt answer for me,
my Lord and my God! Yet a little while, and we shall all
appear at the judgment-seat of Christ!"</p>

<p>Next morning, Whitefield first of all waited upon the
Rev. Mr. Gibbs, Vicar of St. Mary Redcliffe, and asked the
loan of his church, to preach a sermon on behalf of the contemplated
Orphan House in Georgia. Mr. Gibbs refused,
saying, "he could not lend his church without a special
order from the chancellor." Nothing daunted, Whitefield
went at once to the chancellor, who declined to issue an
order for Mr. Gibbs, but stated that if any clergyman
thought proper to lend his church to Whitefield, he (the
chancellor) would not prohibit it; nevertheless, he advised
Whitefield to go to some other town until the bishop had
been consulted. Whitefield was far too ardent and impetuous
to wait for the bishop's leave, and, hence, from the
chancellor, he proceeded direct to the residence of the dean.
Having shewn him his "Georgia Accounts," he asked, "Can
there be any just objection against my preaching in churches
for the Orphan House?" "I cannot tell," replied the
dean, "but I will give you an answer some other time;
now I am expecting company." "Will you be pleased to
fix a time, sir?" "I will send to you," said the dean;
and so ended Whitefield's interview, number three.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied, that, in all this, there was a display
of more self-confidence than is commendable. Whitefield
was a young man, not yet twenty-five; he had neither high
rank, nor special scholarship to recommend him to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Church dignitaries of the day; his ecclesiastical standing was
extremely insignificant&mdash;only incumbent of the distant and
small settlement of Savannah. It is true, he had, a year and
a half ago, moved both Bristol and the metropolis by his
earnest, startling, godly eloquence; but, during the interval,
his injudicious friends had published his Journals, written
with the utmost artlessness, but containing much never
meant for the public eye; and, within the last few days,
by the rash proceedings of certain of his admirers, he had
been placed in an equivocal position at St. Margaret's,
Westminster. Remembering all this, it was doubtless a bold&mdash;some
would call it a presumptuous&mdash;act to ask the loan
of the Abbey Church, at Bath, and, next to the Cathedral, of
the finest church in Bristol; and further, it is hardly surprising
that his well-intentioned applications were refused.</p>

<p>Whitefield was baffled, but not discomfited. Churches,
for the present, might be closed against him, but there
was Bristol prison; there were the rooms of the Religious
Societies; and there was Kingswood Hill.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the very day, when his diplomacy
with three of the principal ecclesiastics in Bristol was such
a mortifying failure, he tried his skill with another functionary
of a more humble order. At this period, the keeper of
Bristol Prison was a Mr. Dagge, whom Dr. Johnson has
immortalized in his Life of the poet Savage.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Mr. Dagge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
had been amongst the firstfruits of Whitefield's ministry in
Bristol prison, in 1737,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> and Whitefield's application to him
was more successful than those he had made to the vicar,
the chancellor, and the dean. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"About three in the afternoon, God having given me great favour in the
gaoler's eyes, I preached a sermon on the Penitent Thief, to the poor
prisoners in Newgate, and collected fifteen shillings for them."</p></blockquote>

<p>This was the beginning. Next morning, he made an
arrangement, that, while he remained in Bristol, he would
read prayers and preach to the prisoners every day, an
arrangement which was faithfully fulfilled, until the 12th of
March, when the mayor and the sheriffs thought it their
duty to interfere, and absolutely commanded Mr. Dagge not
to allow Whitefield to preach in the prison-house again,
alleging, as their reason, that he insisted upon the necessity
of our being born again&mdash;a thing which those custodians, if
not regenerators, of outcast men, were unable to understand.</p>

<p>Whitefield's preaching to the prisoners, however, was but
a small part of his public labours in Bristol and in the
neighbourhood. His present sojourn here lasted between six
and seven weeks, during which he preached above sixty
times, and expounded fifty.</p>

<p>Closing the churches against him was not the way to
silence him. His "heart was hot within him;" while he
mused "the fire burned;" and to speak with his tongue became
almost a necessity of life. For the present, he had the
use of the city prison; but fancy a man like Whitefield being
satisfied with a cure of souls all under a single roof! The
opportunity of preaching to Mr. Dagge's domestics was important,
and doubtless useful; but it was not enough; and,
hence, as Whitefield had no other place in which to preach,
away he went, and, for the first time in England, in the
bleak month of February, preached out of doors, to a congregation
of colliers, on Kingswood Hill. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1739. February 17, Saturday. About one in the afternoon, I went
with my brother (William) Seward, and another friend to Kingswood, and
was most delightfully entertained by an old disciple of the Lord. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
bowels have long yearned toward the poor colliers, who are very numerous,
and as sheep having no shepherd. After dinner, therefore, I went
upon a mount, and spake to as many people as came unto me. They
were upwards of two hundred. Blessed be God that I have now broken
the ice! I believe I was never more acceptable to my Master than when
I was standing to teach those hearers in the open fields. Some may
censure me; but if I thus pleased men, I should not be the servant of
Christ."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thus began, apparently without intention, the marvellous
outdoor services which distinguished the career of Whitefield
and the Wesleys. This was only three days after
Whitefield came to Bristol. He would have preferred the
churches; but, even in the midst of winter, was thankful
for the open fields. It is a remarkable fact, however, that,
though when he arrived in Bristol, every church was closed
against him, on the very day immediately succeeding that
on which he set his pulpit on Kingswood Hill, the pulpits of
three of the Bristol churches were freely offered him. Hear
what he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1739. February 18, Sunday. Arose this morning about six, being
called up by near fifty young persons, whom I appointed to meet at my
sister's house, and with whom I spent above an hour in prayer, psalm-singing,
and a warm exhortation. Soon after this, I read prayers and
preached at Newgate, to a large and very attentive congregation. At ten,
I preached at St. Werburg's, to a large audience. I thought yesterday I
should not have the use of any pulpit; but God, who has the hearts of all
men in His hands, disposed the Rev. Mr. Penrose to lend me his; and
the Rev. Mr. Gibbs sent to me and offered me the use both of St. Thomas's
and St. Mary Redcliffe. I accepted the latter of these, and preached to
such a congregation as my eyes never yet saw. Many went away for want
of room, and Mr. Gibbs and his lady were exceeding civil both to me and
Mr. Seward."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the following day, Whitefield had the use of another
church, the parish church of St. Philip and Jacob, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
he preached, to a great multitude, in the afternoon, and
collected £18 for the Orphan House in Georgia. "Thousands,"
says he, "went away, because there was no room for
them within."</p>

<p>This was too much for the equanimity of the Chancellor
of the Bristol Diocese. Only four days before, he had
virtually prohibited Whitefield preaching in any of the Bristol
churches, without the bishop's leave being first obtained;
and yet already had the young preacher had the hardihood
to occupy three of the city churches, and was not at
all unlikely to preach in others. Official patience with the
ordained upstart was exhausted, and the apparitor was sent
to summons Whitefield to the court of the Rev. Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;l,
the ecclesiastical lawyer of the Bishop of Bristol, versed in
civil and canon law, and solemnly appointed to direct the
bishop in the criminal and civil causes of the Church.</p>

<p>The summons was served on Tuesday, February 20,
and was immediately obeyed. On Whitefield's appearance,
the chancellor informed him that he intended "to stop his
proceedings;" and that the registrar of the court was present
to take down his answers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Chancellor.</em> "By what authority do you preach in the diocese of Bristol
without a license?"</p>

<p><em>Whitefield.</em> "I thought that custom was grown obsolete. Pray, sir,
why did you not ask the Irish clergyman this question, who preached for
you last Thursday?"</p>

<p><em>C.</em> "That is nothing to you." Then, reading part of the Ordination
Office, and the canons forbidding ministers to preach in private houses,
he asked, "What do you say to these?"</p>

<p><em>W.</em> "I apprehend these canons do not belong to professed ministers of
the Church of England."</p>

<p><em>C.</em> "But they do."</p>

<p><em>W.</em> "There is a canon forbidding all clergymen to frequent taverns,
and play at cards. Why is not that put in execution?"</p>

<p><em>C.</em> "Why does not somebody lodge complaints? In such a case it
would."</p>

<p>Referring to his printed sermons for his principles, Whitefield asked,
"Why am I singled out?"</p>

<p><em>C.</em> "You preach false doctrine."</p>

<p><em>W.</em> "I cannot but speak the things that I know, and am resolved to
proceed as usual."</p>

<p><em>C.</em> "Mr. Registrar, observe his answer." Then turning to Whitefield,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
"I am resolved, sir, if you preach or expound anywhere in this diocese,
till you have a license, I will first suspend, and then excommunicate
you."</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon this, Whitefield says, "I took my leave. He
waited upon me very civilly to the door, and told me, 'What
I do is in the name of the clergy and laity of the city of
Bristol;' and so we parted."</p>

<p>With this ended Whitefield's ministry in Bristol churches.
Meanwhile, however, he had written both to the Bishop of
Bristol, and the Bishop of Bath and Wells. From the
former, the celebrated Dr. Butler, author of the well-known
"Analogy of Religion," etc., he received an answer
on February 24, with which he again waited on the chancellor;
but without success. Bishop Butler's letter is not
preserved; but Whitefield's reply was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Bristol</span>, <em>February 24, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;I humbly thank your lordship for the favour of your lordship's
letter. It gave abundant satisfaction to me, and many others, who
have not failed to pray in a particular manner for your lordship's temporal
and eternal welfare. To-day, I shewed your lordship's letter to the
chancellor, who (notwithstanding he promised not to prohibit my preaching
for the Orphan House if your lordship was only neutral in the affair) has
influenced most of the clergy to deny me their pulpits, either on that or
any other occasion. Last week, he was pleased to charge me with false
doctrine. To-day, he has forgotten that he said so. He also threatened
to excommunicate me for preaching in your lordship's diocese. I offered
to take a license, but was denied.</p>

<p>"If your lordship should ask, What evil have I done? I answer, None,
save that I visit the Religious Societies, preach to the prisoners in Newgate,
and to the poor colliers in Kingswood, who, I am told, are little better
than heathens. I am charged with being a Dissenter; though many are
brought to the Church by my preaching, not one taken from it. The
chancellor is pleased to tell me my conduct is contrary to the canons;
but I told him that the canons, which he produced, were not intended
against such meetings as mine are, where His Majesty is constantly prayed
for, and every one is free to see what is done.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to give your lordship this trouble; but I thought it proper
to mention these particulars, that I might know wherein my conduct is
exceptionable.</p>

<p>"I heartily thank your lordship for your intended benefaction. I think
the design is truly good, and will meet with success, because so much
opposed.</p>

<p>"God knows my heart. I desire only to promote His glory. If I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
spoken evil of, for His sake, I rejoice in it. My Master was long since
spoken evil of before me. But I intrude on your lordship's patience.</p>

<p>"I am, with all possible thanks, my lord, your lordship's dutiful son
and servant,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>So the matter ended. Curiosity would like to know what
a man so eminent as Bishop Butler thought of the young
Methodist, and what he said to him; but, unfortunately, the
bishop's sentiments are not producible.</p>

<p>What was Whitefield to do next? He might at once
have gone back to Georgia; but he wanted money
to erect his Orphan House, and was not content to return
without it. Besides, he seemed to consider the prohibition
to preach in churches a kind of call to preach elsewhere.
Preach he must. God had called him to the work. By the
Bishop of Gloucester, he had been ordained to it. If churches
were inaccessible, his only alternative was to make use of
private houses, public rooms, and open fields.</p>

<p>The Religious Societies gladly accepted his services. He
speaks of the Room of the Baldwin Street Society, together
with the stairs and the court below, being crowded with
people, profoundly attentive and powerfully affected. Here
his expositions, more than once, were of two hours' duration;
and, at one of the meetings, upwards of £5 was collected for
his Orphan House. At his farewell service, the crowd about
the place was such, that he had to climb a ladder, and go
over the roof of an adjoining house, in order to get into the
Room. The meeting-place of the Nicholas Street Society
was quite as thronged as that of Baldwin Street; and here,
by his recommendation, a charity school was opened, for
which, he says, "I collected at the door myself, and few
passed by without throwing in their mites." The Room of
the Society without Lawford's Gate seems to have been
connected with the parish poorhouse, and was sometimes so
crowded, that Whitefield had to preach from the steps leading
to the door, and sometimes to stand at the window, and there
preach to those outside and those within. On one occasion,
at the poorhouse, he made a collection for his contemplated
orphanage; "and the poor people," says he, "so loaded my
hat, that I wanted some one to hold up my hands. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
cheerfulness with which they gave was inexpressible; and
the many prayers they joined with their alms will, I hope,
lay a good foundation for the house intended to be built."</p>

<p>When Newgate was closed against him, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1739, March 14. Being forbid preaching in the prison, and, withal,
being resolved not to give place to my adversaries, no, not for an hour, I
preached at Baptist Mills, a place very near to the city, to three or four
thousand people. Blessed be God! all things happen for the furtherance
of the Gospel. I now preach to ten times more people than I should if
I had been confined to the churches. Surely the devil is blind, and so
are his emissaries, or otherwise they would not thus confound themselves.
Every day I am invited to fresh places. I will go to as many as I can;
the rest I must leave unvisited till it shall please God to bring me back
from Georgia."</p></blockquote>

<p>In this way, Whitefield became an itinerant outdoor
preacher. At four different times, he went to Bath. Here
he met the Rev. Griffith Jones, a devoted clergyman, who,
two years before, had instituted his locomotive schools for
educating the children of the poor in Wales, and who gave
to Whitefield "an account of the many obstructions" he had
encountered in his ministry, and convinced his visitor that
he "was but a young soldier just entering the field." Here
also he was introduced to the Rev. George Thompson, Vicar
of St. Gennys, Cornwall, from the first a hearty friend of
the Oxford Methodists.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> He read prayers at the hospital;
and, in the midst of a storm of snow, preached on the
"Town Common." On another occasion, he preached out
of doors to a congregation of four or five thousand, "of high
and low, rich and poor." He writes: "As I went along, I
observed many scoffers; and, when I got upon the table to
preach, many laughed; but, before I had finished my prayer,
all were hushed and silent; and, ere I had concluded my
discourse, God, by His word, seemed to impress a great awe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
upon their minds; for all were deeply attentive, and appeared
much affected with what had been spoken."</p>

<p>Whitefield went to Brislington, "a village," says he,
"about two miles from Bristol, where was such a vast
congregation, that, after I had read prayers in the church,
I thought proper to preach in the churchyard,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> that
none might be sent empty away. The people were exceedingly
attentive, and God gave me great utterance; and,
what was best of all, by the leave of the minister who
invited me thither, we had a sacrament, and I hope it was
a communion of saints indeed."</p>

<p>He writes again:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1739, Friday, March 16. Being much entreated by the people, and
horses being sent for me, I went and preached at Elberton, a village
about nine miles from Bristol. The clergyman denied me the pulpit; so
I preached on a little ascent on which the May-pole was fixed. The
weather being cold, and the adjacent villages having but little notice, I
had not above two hundred hearers.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> After dinner, I hastened to Thornbury,
and preached to a great part of my morning congregation, and
many hundreds besides. Mr. Willis, the incumbent, lent me the church,
and used me with great civility, as did two other clergymen who were
there present."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield also preached at Keynsham, where "great
numbers of horsemen from Bristol" met him, "besides several
thousands from the neighbouring villages." "The church
being refused, he preached on a mount."</p>

<p>He likewise went to Publow, "a village about five miles
from Bristol. The church was offered; but, not being
sufficient to contain a third part of the audience," he preached
in the open air.</p>

<p>At Coal-pit Heath, seven miles from Bristol, his congregation
numbered above two thousand. The yard of the
Glass-house, Bristol, was another of his preaching places.
Here his "congregation consisted of many thousands."
While he was preaching, "a gentleman (being drunk)" called
him a dog, and said he "ought to be whipped at the cart's
tail, and offered money to any that would pelt" him; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
"the boys and people," instead of pelting the preacher,
"began to cast stones and dirt" at the inebriated gentleman.</p>

<p>In Bristol, also, a large bowling-green was lent to Whitefield,
where he preached twice in the last week in the month
of March. On the first occasion, he says, he had a congregation
of "about five thousand people, and made a collection
for his poor orphans, till his hands were quite weary." On
the second, he writes, "I believe seven or eight thousand
people were present. The sun shone bright, and the windows
and balconies of the adjoining houses were filled with hearers.
I again collected for the Orphan House, and it was near an
hour and a half before the people could go out. Many were
very faint because of the throng, which was so exceeding
great that they trod one upon another."</p>

<p>Strangely enough, at Winterbourne, and at Frenchay,
he had, in private, friendly meetings with the Quakers; but,
he says, he was not at all convinced by their arguments
against paying tithes, an outward call to the ministry, and
baptism, and the Lord's supper, though he admits that "their
notions about walking and being led by the Spirit were right
and good."</p>

<p>On the 6th of March, he and William Seward went off to
Wales; the Rev. Richard Hutchins, afterwards Rector of
Lincoln College, taking his place at Bristol. This, in its
ultimate results, was an important visit; and, though only
of four days' duration, was full of incident.</p>

<p>Here, however, an extract from a letter written by William
Seward may be interjected.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">New Passage, Bristol-side</span>, <em>March 6, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and dear Brother</span>,&mdash;Our dear brother Whitefield
goes on from conquering to conquer. Thousands and ten thousands
flock to hear the word. He has been in but three churches, and that
was at his first coming. The chancellor threatened excommunication, but
soon dropt it. However, the glory of God was to be promoted another
way; for, being thrust out of the synagogues, our brother has settled a
lecture or exposition at Newgate every morning; the place being more
convenient than Oxford Castle Chapel. He generally expounds to one,
two, or three Societies every night; and has preached seven or eight times
on a mount, about two miles from Bristol, where have been from fifteen
hundred to fifteen thousand hearers. Last Sunday evening, we sung the
hundredth psalm, and all could hear. It is much like singing at a scaffold
or stake with multitudes around. At another place, the church not being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
big enough, he preached from the cross. He preaches once a week on
the steps of a workhouse, with a hall behind, and a courtyard almost full
before. He has preached in two other parts of Kingswood, among the
colliers; and thousands come&mdash;horsemen, coaches, chaises, etc. Thus
the gospel spreads round the country, for divers come from far&mdash;<em>some</em>
twenty miles. You may be sure we are set up for being stark mad.
We are now going to meet our brother Howell Harris at Cardiff, the
minister of which place being here will not even go over in the passage-boat
with us. He says our brother shall not have the church; so I hope
the fields will be white at Cardiff, as well as at Bristol. There is also a
Society there who long for our coming. Our brother Hutchins is at Bristol,
and stays till brother Kinchin comes to supply his place. Our dear
brother Whitefield would have none of you ('the Oxford Methodists')
hidden, but wishes that you would all come out, and be itinerant. The
harvest is great, and great encouragement there is to spend and be spent
for the good of souls. I hear brother J. Wesley is at Oxford; and that
forty gownsmen were lately to hear brother Kinchin expound. O praise
the Lord for these His great mercies!</p>

"<span class="smcap">William Seward</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>At the <em>New Passage</em>, where Whitefield and Seward had a
twelve hours' detention, the Cardiff clergyman, who refused
to go in the "passage-boat" because Whitefield was going,
employed his enforced leisure in "shaking his elbows over
a gaming table." Whitefield's Journal, published about four
months afterwards, contained this incident, and also Whitefield's
reflections on it. The clergyman became very wroth,
and wrote a letter, dated "Cardiff, July 17, 1739," and
signed "Nath. Well," which filled nearly two folio pages of
the <cite>Weekly Miscellany</cite>. Mr. Well calls Whitefield's Journals
"rhapsodies, and repetitions of spiritual pride, vanity, and
nonsense." He says Whitefield's statement respecting his
refusal to go in the passage-boat is not correct, for he
actually went in it. Mr. Well's assertion is both true and
false. At first he refused to go, as Whitefield says he did;
but, during the long detention at the New Passage, Mr.
Well changed his mind and went.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Mr. Well further states
that Whitefield and William Seward "sang hymns the best
part of the passage, till the pilot, hindered by their noise
from hearing the man appointed to look out, obliged them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to give over." He also adds, that Whitefield had advised
Howell Harris not to offer himself for holy orders, alleging
the "fanatical argument, 'that the success with which the
Holy Spirit had blessed his labours was a sufficient evidence
and proof of his <em>divine</em> commission, and he <em>needed</em>
no other.' And yet his <em>boasted</em> success is this: he has
alienated the <em>affections</em> of <em>ignorant</em> people from their <em>parish
ministers</em>, and sent most of them to <em>dissenting</em> meeting-houses."</p>

<p>Whitefield's account of his trip to Wales shall be given
in his own language. After relating the incident respecting
Mr. Well at the New Passage, he writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1739, Wednesday, March 8. Arose before twelve at night, sung
psalms, and prayed; and, the wind being fair, we had a speedy passage
over to the Welsh shore. Our business being in haste, and one being
sent to guide us, we rode all night, and reached Cardiff about eleven in
the morning.</p>

<p>"Whilst I was giving a word of exhortation to some poor people at
the inn, Mr. Seward went to ask for the pulpit; but, being denied, we
pitched on the Town Hall, which Mr. Seward got by his interest; and,
at four in the afternoon, I preached from the judge's seat to about four
hundred hearers. Most were very attentive; but some mocked.</p>

<p>"After I came from the seat, I was much refreshed with the sight of
my dear brother, Howell Harris.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> A burning and shining light has he
been in those parts; a barrier against profaneness and immorality, and
an indefatigable promoter of the true gospel of Jesus Christ. About three
or four years God has inclined him to go about doing good. He is now
above twenty-five years of age. Twice he has applied (being every way
qualified) for holy orders; but he was refused, under a false pretence that
he was not of age, though he was then twenty-two years and six months.
About a month ago he offered himself again, but was put off. Upon this,
he was, and is still, resolved to go on in his work. For these three years,
he has discoursed almost twice every day for three or four hours together,
not authoritatively as a minister, but as a private person exhorting his
Christian brethren. He has been in seven counties, and has made it his
business to go to wakes, etc., to turn people from such lying vanities.
Many alehouse people, fiddlers, and harpers sadly cry out against him
for spoiling their business. He has been made the subject of numbers
of sermons; has been threatened with public prosecutions; and had
constables sent to apprehend him. But God has blessed him with inflexible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
courage; and he still continues to go on from conquering to conquer.
He is of a most catholic spirit, and loves all who love our Lord Jesus
Christ; and therefore he is styled by bigots a Dissenter. Many call him
their spiritual father, and, I believe, would lay down their lives for his
sake. He discourses generally in a field; but at other times in a house,
from a wall, a table, or anything else. He has established near thirty
Societies, and still his sphere of action is enlarged daily. He is full of
faith and the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>"When I first saw him, my heart was knit closely to him. I wanted to
catch some of his fire, and gave him the right hand of fellowship with my
whole heart. We spent the evening in telling one another what God had
done for our souls, and took an account of the several Societies, and
agreed on such measures as seemed most conducive to promote the
common interest of our Lord. I doubt not but Satan envied our happiness;
but I hope by the help of God we shall make his kingdom shake.
God loves to do great things by weak instruments, that the power may be
of God, and not of man. The partition wall of bigotry and party zeal is
broken down in Wales, and ministers and teachers of different communions
join with one heart and one mind to carry on the kingdom of Jesus
Christ. The Lord make all the Christian world thus minded! For till
this is done, I fear, we must despair of any great reformation in the Church
of God.</p>

<p>"Thursday, March 9. Spent the beginning of the morning in prayer
and private discourse with the members of the Religious Society. About
ten, I went to the Town Hall, and preached for about an hour and a half
to a large assembly of people. My dear brother, Howell Harris, sat close
by me. I did not observe any scoffers within; but without some were
pleased to honour me so far as to trail a dead fox, and hunt it round about
the hall. After I had concluded, I went with many of my hearers, amongst
whom were two worthy dissenting ministers and my brother Howell
Harris, to public worship. In the Second Lesson were these remarkable
words, 'And the high priest, and the scribes, and the chief of the people
sought to destroy Him; but they could not find what they might do to
Him: for all the people were attentive to hear Him.' In the afternoon, I
preached again to the people, without any scoffing or disturbance; and, at
six in the evening, I talked for above an hour and a half, and prayed with
the Religious Society, whose room was quite thronged.</p>

<p>"Friday, March 10. Left Cardiff about six in the morning, and reached
Newport about ten, where many came from Pontypool and other parts to
hear me. The minister having readily granted us the pulpit, I preached
to about a thousand people. Wales is excellently well prepared for the
Gospel of Christ. They have many burning and shining lights both
among the Dissenting and Church ministers, amongst whom Mr. Griffith
Jones shines in particular.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> No less than fifty charity schools have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
erected by his means, without any settled visible fund, and fresh ones are
setting up every day. People make nothing of coming twenty miles to
hear a sermon, and great numbers there are who have not only been
hearers, but doers also of the word.</p>

<p>"Saturday, March 11. Got safe to Bristol, with my dear fellow-travellers,
about eleven at night."</p></blockquote>

<p>These extracts from Whitefield's Journal are important, as
shewing the work which had been begun, and which was
prospering in Wales before Whitefield and the Wesleys
commenced their great itinerant mission. The reader also
has here the beginning of the warm-hearted friendship between
Whitefield and Howell Harris, and of their evangelical
co-operation, which issued in the founding of the Societies of
the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists, and in other results which
cannot now be noticed. What the "measures" were which
Whitefield and Harris agreed upon for further promoting
the work of God in Wales, it is impossible to determine;
but henceforth the two were fellow-workers, and lived in the
happiest amity.</p>

<p>Whitefield's labours during the seven weeks he spent
at Bristol and in its neighbourhood were marvellous; but
the most picturesque were those among the Kingswood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
colliers. It would be superfluous, it would be wearisome,
to describe Kingswood and its ignorant and rude inhabitants,
at the period now in question. This has been
done so often, that Methodist readers already know all that
Methodist writers have to tell on such a subject. Still,
Whitefield's first services in this benighted neighbourhood
cannot be omitted; for, in reality, Kingswood was the
rough cradle in which Methodism was first rocked and
nursed.</p>

<p>Here it was, on February 17, that Whitefield, for the first
time, dared to be so irregular as to preach in the open air,
his congregation consisting of upwards of two hundred
persons. Altogether he preached about twenty sermons,
from February 17 to April 2, in different parts of Kingswood,
including Hannam Mount, Rose Green, and the Fish
Ponds. Most of these were scenes of solemn grandeur.
On February 23, when he estimated his congregation at
from four to five thousand, he writes: "The sun shone very
bright, and the people, standing in such an awful manner
round the mount, in the profoundest silence, filled me with
holy admiration." Two days later, he says: "At a moderate
computation, there were above ten thousand people present.
The trees and hedges were full. All was hush when I
began, and God enabled me to preach for an hour, with
great power, and so loud that all (I was told) could hear
me. Blessed be God! Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;n spoke right when he
said, 'The fire is kindled in the country, and all the devils
in hell shall not be able to quench it.'" On March 18,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> at
Rose Green, he calculated his congregation at not less than
twenty thousand, and remarks, "To behold such crowds
stand about us in such awful silence, and to hear the echo of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
their singing, is very solemn and surprising. My discourse
continued for near an hour and a half." At the same place,
on April 1, "There were twenty-four coaches and an exceeding
great number of other people, besides the colliers,
both on foot and horseback." Such was his success among
the begrimed Kingswood colliers, that, before he left, they
gave him £20 in money, and promised £40 in subscriptions,
towards the erection of a Charity School, which he wished
to build for the instruction of their children. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"March 29. Were I to continue here, I would endeavour to settle
schools all over the Wood, and also in other places, as Mr. Griffith Jones
has done in Wales. I have but just time to set it on foot. I hope God
will bless the ministry of my honoured friend, Mr. John Wesley, and
enable him to bring it to good effect. It is a pity so many little ones as
there are in Kingswood should perish for lack of knowledge."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield had requested Wesley to visit Bristol. The
latter writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"March, 1739. During my stay in London, I was fully employed,
between our own Society in Fetter Lane, and many others, where I was
continually desired to expound; so that I had no thought of leaving
London when I received, after several others, a letter from Mr. Whitefield,
and another from Mr. Seward, entreating me in the most pressing manner
to come to Bristol without delay. This I was not at all forward to do, and
perhaps the less inclined to it (though I trust I do not count my life dear
unto myself, so I may finish my course with joy), because of the remarkable
scriptures which offered as often as we enquired, touching the consequence
of this removal&mdash;probably permitted for the trial of our faith:
Deut. xxxii. 49, 50; Deut. xxxiv. 8; Acts ix. 16, and Acts viii. 2.</p>

<p>"March 28. My journey was proposed to our Society in Fetter Lane, but
my brother Charles would scarce bear the mention of it; till, appealing to
the oracles of God, he received those words as spoken to himself, and
answered not again: 'Son of man, behold,' etc. (Ezek. xxiv. 16). Our
other brethren, however, continuing the dispute, without any probability of
their coming to a conclusion, we at length all agreed to decide it by lot.
And by this it was determined that I should go. Several afterwards
desiring we might open the Bible, concerning the issue of this, we did so
on the several portions of Scripture, which I shall set down without any
reflection on them. They were 2 Sam. iii. 1; 2 Sam. iv. 11; and 2 Chron.
xxviii. 27."</p></blockquote>

<p>This narrative, of combined bibliomancy and sortilege, is
a curious one, but let it pass. Fortunately, by the kindness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of Mr. G. Stampe, of Grimsby, I am able to furnish the
reader with Whitefield's letter, never before published. It
was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Bristol</span>, <em>March 22, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend Sir</span>,&mdash;I rejoice at the success which God has given you at
Oxford and elsewhere. I immediately kneeled down and prayed that you
may go on from conquering to conquer.</p>

<p>"I thank you most heartily for your kind rebuke. I can only say it was
too tender. I beseech you, whenever you see me do wrong, rebuke me
sharply. I have still a word or two to offer in defence of my behaviour,
but shall defer it till I come to town. If I have offended, I humbly ask
pardon, and desire the brethren to pray that I may be such as God would
have me be.</p>

<p>"If the brethren, after prayer for direction, think proper, I wish you
would be here the latter end of next week. Brother Hutchins sets out
to-morrow for Dummer. Mr. Chapman brings a horse to London, which
you may ride. I go away, God willing, next Monday sennight. If you
were here, before my departure, it might be best. Many are ripe for bands.
I leave that entirely to you. I am but a novice; you are acquainted with
the great things of God. Come, I beseech you; come quickly. I have
promised not to leave this people till you or somebody come to supply
my place. I am resigned to Brother Hutton's coming hither. The good
Lord direct him!</p>

<p>"Desire the brethren's advice in the following case. Joseph is arrived.
Because he would not submit to a lot, whether he should go with me to
England or not, I said he never should return if he went. On board, he
behaved well, exceeding well. What shall I do? Shall I keep to my
vow that he should not return? or shall I break it? I am indifferent.
I will do as the brethren shall direct.</p>

<p>"Great comfort and joy in the Holy Ghost does God, of His free grace,
give me. I find myself strengthened in the inner man day by day. I feel
an intenseness of love, and long that all should be partakers of it. I hope
I grow in grace. To free grace be all the glory!</p>

<p>"God will fight for our dear brother Charles. I thank him for his letter.
Blessed be God that both of you are not so brief as usual. God will bring
light out of darkness. All these things are not against, but for us.</p>

<p>"Be pleased to bring the Account of my Temptations with you; and,
though unworthy, permit me to subscribe myself, Reverend Sir,</p>

<p class="sig">
"Your dutiful son and servant,<br />
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>.
</p>

<p>"P.S. March 23. I beseech you come next week; it is advertised in
this day's journal. I pray for a blessing on your journey, and in our meetings.
The people expect you much. Though you come <em>after</em>, I heartily
wish you may be preferred <em>before</em> me. Even so, Lord Jesus. Amen.
Our brethren are here together. They advise you should go through
Basingstoke, and call at Dummer, and there take the horse Brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Hutchins rides thither. Whosoever you may appoint shall ride Brother
Chapman's. The Lord direct us all in all things!</p>

<p>"The Rev. Mr. John Wesley, at Mr. John Bray's, a Brazier, in Little
Britain, in Aldersgate Street, London."</p></blockquote>

<p>There are many points in this deeply interesting letter
which deserve attention; such as the fact, that, notwithstanding
Whitefield's taunt on Wesley, within two years
afterwards, respecting the practice of sortilege, he himself
now believed in it, and was in favour of its being used.
Want of space, however, prevents enlargement.</p>

<p>Eight days after the date of Whitefield's letter, Wesley
arrived in Bristol, to prosecute the wondrous work which his
young friend had been honoured to begin; and, on April 2nd,
Whitefield took his leave; and, with the exception of one
day's visit in the month of July following, for the next two
years the Bristol and Kingswood congregations were entrusted
solely to the care of the Wesley brothers and of the
lay evangelists who became their fellow-labourers. Whitefield
shall give his own account of his departure from
Methodism's cradle:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1739. Monday, April 2. Spent a good part of the morning in talking
with those who came to take their leave; and tongue cannot express what
a sorrowful parting we had. My heart was so melted, that I prayed for
them with strong cryings and many tears. About one, I was obliged to
force myself away. Crowds were waiting at the door to give me a last
farewell, and near twenty friends accompanied me on horseback. Blessed
be God for the marvellous great kindness He hath shewn me in Bristol!
Many sinners, I believe, have been effectually converted; numbers have
come to me under convictions; and all the children of God have been
exceedingly comforted. Several thousands of little books have been
dispersed among the people. About £200 have been collected for the
Orphan House, and many poor families have been relieved by the bounty
of my friend Mr. Seward. What gives me the greater comfort is the consideration
that my dear and honoured friend, Mr. Wesley, is left behind
to confirm those that are awakened, so that, when I return from Georgia,
I hope to see many bold soldiers of Jesus Christ.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>
<p>"Having taken my leave, and passed through the people of Bristol, I
came about two to Kingswood, where the colliers, unknown to me, had
prepared an hospitable entertainment, and were very forward for me to lay
the first stone of their school. A man giving me a piece of ground (in
case Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; should refuse to grant them any), I laid a stone, and then
kneeled down on it, and prayed that the gates of hell might not prevail
against our design. The colliers said a hearty <em>Amen</em>, and, after I had
given them a word of exhortation suitable to the occasion, I took my
leave, promising that I would come amongst them again, if ever God
should bring me back to England. I hope a reformation will be carried
on amongst them. For my own part, I had rather preach the gospel to
the unprejudiced ignorant colliers, than to the bigotted, self-righteous,
formal Christians. The colliers will enter into the kingdom of God
before them."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, by kneeling on a loose stone, deposited in a piece
of ground, provisionally promised as a site for the erection,
was begun the memorable Kingswood School. This is not
the place to relate the details of the ministry of Wesley and
his brother, nor to dwell upon the history of Kingswood
School. Suffice it to say, that, on the 12th of May next
ensuing, Wesley, in Bristol, laid the foundation-stone of his
first Methodist meeting-house; and that, in the month of
June, he began to build the School in Kingswood. The
following extract, also, from Wesley's Journal, is full of
interest, and perfectly appropriate. It was written eight
months after Wesley became Whitefield's successor in Bristol
and its neighbourhood:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Few persons have lived long in the west of England, who have not
heard of the colliers of Kingswood; a people famous, from the beginning
hitherto, for neither fearing God nor regarding man; so ignorant of the
things of God, that they seemed but one remove from the beasts that
perish; and, therefore, utterly without desire of instruction, as well as
without the means of it.</p>

<p>"Many, last winter, used tauntingly to say of Mr. Whitefield, 'If he
will convert heathens, why does he not go to the colliers of Kingswood?'
In spring, he did so; and as there were thousands who resorted to no
place of public worship, he went after them into their own wilderness,
'to seek and save that which was lost.' When he was called away, others
went into 'the highways and hedges, to compel them to come in.' And,
by the grace of God, their labour was not in vain. The scene is already
changed. Kingswood does not now, as a year ago, resound with cursing
and blasphemy. It is no more filled with drunkenness and uncleanness,
and the idle diversions that naturally lead thereto. It is no longer full of
wars and fightings, of clamour and bitterness, of wrath and envyings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Peace and love are there. Great numbers of the people are mild, gentle,
and easy to be entreated. They 'do not cry, neither strive;' and hardly
is their 'voice heard in the streets,' or indeed in their own wood, unless
when they are at their usual evening diversion,&mdash;singing praise unto God
their Saviour."</p></blockquote>

<p>Leaving Wesley at Bristol, Whitefield again went off to
Wales, preaching in the open air at Thornbury and at the
<em>Old Passage</em> on his way. At Usk, on April 4th, he met
Howell Harris; and, being refused the use of the pulpit in
the church, a table was placed under a large tree, upon
which he discoursed "to some hundreds" of attentive
listeners. Attended by a cavalcade of nearly fifty persons,
he proceeded to Pontypool, and preached first in the church,
and then, to the overflowings of his congregations, out of
doors. Thirty horsemen accompanied him to Abergavenny,
where, at "the backside of a garden," he addressed "about
two thousand people, and did not spare the polite scoffers in
the least." About forty on horseback went with him to
Comihoy, where the minister of the church was "a hearty
friend," but the congregation was so large that the churchyard
had to be used as Whitefield's preaching place. "I
could spend some months very profitably in Wales," he
writes; "the longer I am in it, the more I like it. The
people are simple and artless. They have left bigotry more
than the generality of our Englishmen; and, through the
exhortations of Howell Harris, and the ministry of others,
they are hungering and thirsting after the righteousness of
Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>On April 6th, in company with about sixty equestrians,
he reached Caerleon, "a town," says he, "famous for having
thirty British kings buried in it, and for producing three
noble Christian martyrs. I chose particularly to come hither,
because when my brother Howell Harris was here last, some
of the baser sort beat a drum, and huzzaed around him, for
the purpose of disturbing him. But God suffered them not
to move a tongue now, though I preached from the very
same place, and prayed for him by name, as I have in every
place where I have preached in Wales. God forbid I should
be ashamed either of my Master or His servants! Many
thousands were there from all parts, and God gave me such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
extraordinary assistance, that I was carried out beyond
myself."</p>

<p>At Trelegg, Whitefield preached "upon the horse-block
before the inn;" at Chepstow, in the church; and at
Coleford, in the market-house. On April 9th, he arrived at
Gloucester, in the neighbourhood of which he spent the
next eight days. Howell Harris, as well as William
Seward, was his travelling companion. The following is
taken from the <cite>Gloucester Journal</cite> of April 24, 1739:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the 9th inst., the Rev. Mr. Whitefield came to this city (the place
of his nativity) from Wales; having preached in Usk Street; in Pontypool
Church and field; in Abergavenny, from a place built on purpose, against
a gentleman's wall; in Caerleon field, from a pulpit built for the famous
Mr. Howell Harris, who came with him hither, and goes with him to
London. He was attended from Usk to Pontypool, and from thence to
Abergavenny, and to Caerleon, by sixty or seventy horse, so great was the
love of the people to his person, and to his doctrine of the new birth," etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield's ministry in Gloucester and its vicinity was
quite as irregular and as remarkable as it had been in
Wales. On April 10, besides visiting three Religious
Societies in the city, he also preached in St. Michael's
Church; but, on the day following, at the conclusion of his
sermon, the same church was closed against him, on the
ground that "the greatness of his congregations" seriously
interfered with public business. With the exception of
another instance, to be mentioned shortly, these were the
only services that Whitefield was allowed to hold in the
Gloucester churches. The result was, he began to preach, to
assembled thousands, in the Booth Hall, and in a field
attached to the Bell Inn, and belonging to his brother. The
newspaper just quoted says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On Tuesday and Wednesday, he preached at the parish church of St.
Michael's; but that, as well as one other pulpit, being afterwards denied,
and having no prospect of better success with the rest of his brethren, he,
on Thursday, Friday, Sunday, and Monday, preached to some thousands
in a field belonging to the Bell Inn; also on Saturday, Sunday, and
Monday <em>nights</em>, in the Booth Hall, to about three or four thousand each
time. Great power has attended his preaching; great numbers have been
strengthened in their Christian faith, and are exceedingly sorrowful at
his departure from them."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Whitefield's views and feelings will be best expressed in
his own words. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1739, Thursday, April 12th. Preached to nearly three thousand
hearers in a field belonging to my brother. Cry out who will against this
my frowardness, I cannot see my dear countrymen and fellow-Christians
everywhere ready to perish, through ignorance and unbelief, and not
endeavour to convince them of both. I call upon them who forbid me to
speak to these poor baptized heathens, to give a reason for their so doing&mdash;a
reason which may satisfy not man only, but God. I am, and profess
myself, a member of the Church of England. I have received no
prohibition from any of the bishops; and, having had no fault found by
them with my life or doctrine, have the same general license to preach
which the rectors are willing to think sufficient for their curates; nor can
any of them produce one instance of their having refused the assistance
of a stranger clergyman, because he had not a written license. And have
their lordships, the bishops, insisted that no person shall ever preach
occasionally without such special license? Is not our producing our
Letters of Orders <em>always judged sufficient</em>? Have not some of us been
<em>allowed</em> to preach in Georgia and other places, by no other than our
general commission? His lordship of London allowed of my preaching
in Georgia, even when I had only received Deacon's Orders; and I have
never been charged by his lordship with teaching or living otherwise
than as a true minister of the Church of England. I keep close to her
Articles and Homilies, which, if my opposers did, we should not have
so many dissenters from her. But it is most notorious that for the
iniquity of the priests the land mourns. We have <em>preached</em> and <em>lived</em>
many sincere persons out of our communion. I have now conversed with
several of the best of all denominations; and many of them solemnly
protest that they went from the church because they could not find food
for their souls. They stayed among us till they were starved out. I
know this declaration will expose me to the ill-will, not of <em>all</em> my brethren,
but of all my indolent, earthly-minded, pleasure-taking brethren. But
were I not to speak, the very stones would cry out against them. Speak,
therefore, I must, and will, and will not spare. God look to the event!"</p></blockquote>

<p>No doubt all this is true; but still, the clergy had a
right to refuse the use of their churches to the young
evangelist; and it must also be admitted that there is
throughout Whitefield's statement a strain of egotism
scarcely modest, and at the end of it a tone of censoriousness
hardly in harmony with Christian courtesy. Unfortunately,
this was not the only imprudent attack of Whitefield
on the indolence, the earthly-mindedness, and pleasure-taking
habits of his brethren in the ministry. There were
ample grounds for it; but the attack was not politic. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
resulted in no good, and not unreasonably exposed Whitefield
to retaliatory critiques. But more of this anon.</p>

<p>Besides his preaching in the Booth Hall and in his
brother's field, Whitefield preached out of doors at Painswick,
Chalford, Stroud, Stonehouse, and Oxenhall. Strangely
enough, his last service, for the present, was performed in
the church he attended in the days of his boyhood. He
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1739, April 17, Tuesday. About eleven, by the bishop's permission,
I baptized, in the Church of St. Mary de Crypt, Mr. Thomas W&mdash;&mdash;d, a
professed Quaker, about sixty years of age, who was convinced of the
necessity of being born again of <em>water</em> as well as of the <em>Spirit</em>. Many of
Christ's faithful servants attended on the prayers around him; and, I
believe, the Holy Ghost was with us of a truth. After the solemnity was
over, I gave a word of exhortation from the font; and, being the place
where I myself not long since had been baptized, it gave me an
opportunity of reflecting on the frequent breaches of my baptismal vow,
and of proving the necessity of the new birth from the office of our
Church.</p>

<p>"After this, and having dined, I prayed with and took leave of my
weeping friends. When I came to the city, I found the devil had painted
me in most horrible colours; for it was currently reported that I was
really mad, that I had said I was the Holy Ghost, and that I had walked
bare-headed through Bristol streets, singing psalms. But God was
pleased to shew the people that the devil was a liar, and that the words I
spoke were not those of a madman, but the words of soberness and
truth."</p></blockquote>

<p>Having baptized the old Quaker, and unnecessarily repudiated
the stupid charge of being mad, because he
had sung with uncovered head in the streets of Bristol,
he set out for Cheltenham, accompanied by about a
dozen of his friends. Until recently, Cheltenham had
been a poor, straggling hamlet of a few thatched cottages,
sheltered by the Cotswold Hills. The first Spa was discovered
in 1716, and since then, during a period of twenty
years, the insignificant village had been full of bustle, for
its site was in the process of being transformed into
the squares, crescents, terraces, and promenades of the
fashionable Cheltenham of the present day. As Whitefield
and his friends passed along, the rustic inhabitants,
at the doors of their humble cottages, stood and stared.
Whitefield applied for the use of the parish church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
His application was refused; and therefore he preached,
he says, "to near two thousand people,"<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> on the Plough
Inn bowling-green. He adds, "Many were convicted.
One woman wept greatly, because she had said I was
crazy; and some were so filled with the Holy Ghost, that
they were almost unable to support themselves under it."</p>

<p>From Cheltenham, Whitefield proceeded to Evesham, in
the neighbourhood of which he spent three days among the
relatives of his friend William Seward. He shall relate
his own story.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1739, April 18, Wednesday. Got safe to Evesham (where Mr.
Seward's relations live) about seven at night. Several persons came to
see me, amongst whom was Mr. Benjamin Seward, whom God has been
pleased to call by His free grace very lately. For some years he had been
at Cambridge. As touching the law, so far as outward morality went, he
was blameless; but he disliked my proceedings, and once had a mind, he
said, to write against Mr. Law's enthusiastic notions in his 'Christian
Perfection.' Lately, however, he has had an eight days' sickness; in
which time he scarce ever ate, or drank, or slept, and underwent great
inward agonies and tortures. After this, God sent a poor travelling
woman, who came to sell straw toys, to instruct him in the nature of the
second birth; and now he is resolved to prepare for Holy Orders. He is
a gentleman of very large fortune, which he has devoted to God. I write
this to shew how far a man may go, and yet know nothing of Jesus Christ.
Here is one who constantly attended on the means of grace, exact in his
morals, humane and courteous in his conversation, who gave much in
alms, was frequent in private duties; and yet, till about six weeks ago,
was as destitute of any saving, experimental knowledge of Jesus Christ,
as those on whom His name was never called, and who still sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death. How often has my companion and honoured
friend, Mr. William Seward, been deemed a madman, even by this very
brother, for going to Georgia; but now God has made him an instrument
of converting his brother. This, more and more, convinces me that we
must be despised before we can be vessels fit for God's use.</p>

<p>"April 19, Thursday. Went to Badsey, about two miles from Evesham,
where Mr. Seward's eldest brother lives. We were most kindly received.
About four in the afternoon, the churches at Evesham, Bengeworth, and
Badsey being denied, I preached from the cross, in the middle of Evesham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
street, to a great congregation; and then went to Badsey, and preached
in Mr. Seward's brother's yard.</p>

<p>"April 20, Friday. Preached about nine in the morning at the cross
in Evesham, went to public worship, and received the sacrament.
Preached at Badsey at five in the evening, and returned and expounded
in the town hall, which was quite thronged. The recorder himself procured
the keys for us.</p>

<p>"April 21, Saturday. Preached in the morning at Badsey, to a
weeping audience, and set out for Oxford, which I reached at about ten
at night."</p></blockquote>

<p>At Oxford, Whitefield was thrown into amusing perturbation
by an event which might have been expected to secure
his warm approval. Charles Kinchin, one of the most
zealous of the Oxford Methodists, was Rector of Dummer
and Fellow and Dean of Corpus Christi College. Greatly
to Whitefield's distress of mind, Kinchin had resolved to
declare himself a Dissenter. He had left the college, intended
to resign his living, and purposed, as soon as he was really
converted, to become an itinerant preacher.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Whitefield
himself was already an itinerant, either by necessity, or
choice, or both; and yet he seems to have been ridiculously
horrified at the probability of Kinchin following his example.
He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The step taken by Mr. Kinchin gave me a great shock. For I knew
what dreadful consequences would attend a needless separation from the
Established Church. For my own part, I can see no reason for my
leaving the Church, however I am treated by the corrupt members and
ministers of it. I judge of the state of a church, not from the practice of
its members, but its primitive and public constitutions; and so long as I
think the Articles of the Church of England are agreeable to Scripture,
I am resolved to preach them up without either bigotry or party zeal."</p></blockquote>

<p>Already Hervey, another of the Oxford Methodists, had
written to Kinchin a letter, of more than a dozen printed
octavo pages,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> and had strongly and lovingly entreated him
not to leave the Church. Whitefield wrote to the same
effect. His letter is thoroughly characteristic, and abbreviation
would injure it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Oxon</span>, <em>April 22, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dearest Mr. Kinchin</span>,&mdash;Just now I have received the blessed sacrament,
and have been praying for you. Let me exhort you, by the mercies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
God in Christ Jesus, not to resign your parsonage till you have consulted
your friends in London. It is undoubtedly true that all is not right when
we are afraid to be open to our dear brethren.</p>

<p>"Satan has desired to sift you as wheat. He is dealing with you as he
did with me some years ago, when he kept me in my closet near six weeks,
because I could not do anything with a single intention. So he would
have you not to preach till you have received the Holy Ghost in the full
assurance of it; and that is the way never to have it at all. God will be
found in the use of means; and our Lord sent out His disciples to preach
<em>before</em><a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> they had received the Holy Ghost in that most plentiful manner at
the day of Pentecost.</p>

<p>"Besides, consider, my dear brother, what confusion your separation
from the Church will occasion. The prison doors" (at Oxford) "are
already shut" (against us). "Our Society is stopped; and most are
afraid almost to converse with us. I can assure you, that my being a minister
of the Church of England, and preaching its articles, is a means, under
God, of drawing so many after me.</p>

<p>"As for objecting about habits, robes, etc., good God! I thought we
long since knew that the kingdom of God did not consist in any externals,
but in righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear brother, I travail in pain for you. Never was I more
shocked at anything than at your proceedings. I doubt not that you will
pray to God to be kept from delusion at the reading of this. I am not
ignorant of Satan's devices, and I know he never more successfully
tempts us, than when he turns himself into an angel of light. Oh! my
dearest Mr. Kinchin, do nothing rashly. Consult your friends, and do
not break the heart of your most affectionate, though unworthy brother
in Christ,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Though it is not necessary to pursue the subject, it may
be added, 1. That Kinchin was prompted to act as he did
chiefly by three Moravian brethren;<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> 2. Though there can
be little doubt that he resigned his Fellowship and his office
of Dean of Corpus Christi College, it is not certain that he
resigned his living; 3. When he died, on January 4, 1742,
he left behind him a young widow of the age of thirty,
who, ten months afterwards, was one of the enrolled members
of "the Congregation of the Lamb, in London;" and,
within eighteen months after that, became the wife of
Ludolph Ernest Schlicht,<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> who officiated as one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
principal Moravian ministers in London, Dublin, and other
places.</p>

<p>Whitefield spent two days at Oxford, trying to put wrong
things right. Of course, he was not allowed the use of any
of the Oxford churches; but he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I visited two Societies, at the first of which many gownsmen did me
the honour of coming to hear. Before I began, I desired them to behave
like gentlemen and Christians. I also prayed particularly for them, and
applied myself in meekness and love to them at the end of my discourse.
They behaved quietly; but afterwards followed me to my inn, and came
uninvited up into my room. I took that opportunity to give them a second
exhortation; and though some, no doubt, mocked, yet, I believe, some
will remember what was said. Blessed be God for sending me hither!
Our dear brother Kinchin, falling into such an error, has given such a
shock, that, unless I had come, in all probability the brethren would have
been scattered abroad like sheep having no shepherd."</p></blockquote>

<p>Next morning, before setting out for London, Whitefield
conducted another religious service; during which the Vice-Chancellor
of the University came and sent a message,
requesting Whitefield to come downstairs to see him.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> As
soon as the young preacher presented himself, the learned
Don angrily exclaimed, "Have you, sir, a name in any book
here?" "Yes, sir," said Whitefield, "but I intend to take it
out soon." "Yes," replied the wrathful magnate, "and you
had best take yourself out too, or otherwise I will lay you up
by the heels. What do you mean by going about, alienating
the people's affections from their proper pastors? Your works
are full of vanity and nonsense. You pretend to inspiration.
If you ever come again in this manner among these people,
I will lay you first by the heels, and these shall follow."
Having delivered himself of this official threat, the Vice-Chancellor
"turned his back, and went away." "I exhorted
the brethren," says Whitefield, "not to forsake the assembling
of themselves together, though no pastor should be permitted
to come amongst them; for, so long as they continued
steadfast in the communion of the Established Church, I
told them, no power on earth could justify hindering them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
continuing in fellowship, as the primitive Christians did, in
order to build up each other in the knowledge and fear of
God. Oh, what advantage has Satan gained over us by our
brother Kinchin putting off his gown!"</p>

<p>The ungentlemanly menace of the Vice-Chancellor was
an empty one, and yet it evidently caused Whitefield some
anxiety. Hence, on the same day, he wrote as follows to
his friend Harris:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I rejoice to hear Mr. Cole<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> builds you up in your most holy faith. Who
knows but you may, under God, keep up religion in Gloucester? Mr.
Kinchin's conduct, in leaving the Church and giving up the parsonage, has
sadly grieved the spirit of many good people here. My heart is drawn
towards London most strangely. Perhaps you may hear of your friend's
imprisonment. I expect no other preferment. God grant I may behave
so, that when I suffer, it may not be for my own imprudencies, but for
righteousness' sake! Then, I am sure, the spirit of Christ and of glory
will rest upon my soul."</p></blockquote>

<p>On April 25th, Whitefield and his friends, William Seward
and Howell Harris, arrived in London, where (excepting one
or two brief excursions made to other places) he continued
until the end of June. This was a most important epoch in
Whitefield's history, and must be carefully examined.</p>

<p>It is a significant fact, that, though it was through three
Moravians that Charles Kinchin was (as Whitefield thought)
so disastrously led astray, Whitefield still maintained a close
connection with the Moravian Society in Fetter Lane, and,
up to the time of his second embarkation for Georgia,
attended their assemblies, and assisted in their services. He
was really, if not nominally, one of their brotherhood; and,
on Sunday, May 20, made the following entry in his
Journal: "Went with our brethren of Fetter Lane Society
to St. Paul's, and received the holy sacrament, as a testimony
that we adhered to the Church of England."</p>

<p>It was not, however, as a Moravian that Whitefield became
so notable; but as an outdoor preacher, whose congregations,
voice, and oratory were unparalleled.</p>

<p>At this period, the vicar of Islington was the Rev. George
Stonehouse, who had recently been converted, chiefly by
means of Charles Wesley; and who, like Whitefield and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Wesley brothers, evinced great affection for the Moravian
fraternity. In fact, he soon afterwards so identified himself
with the Brethren, that he sold his living, and retired to
Sherborne, in the west of England, where he fitted up a
Moravian meeting house capable of accommodating five
hundred people.</p>

<p>Mr. Stonehouse was now the only clergyman in London
willing to lend his pulpit to poor outcast Whitefield; and
even he was not able to carry out his wishes. Whitefield,
the day after he reached London, wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thursday, April 26. Assisted in administering the blessed sacrament
at Islington, where the vicar, in conformity to the rubric, takes care to
observe the octaves of Easter.</p>

<p>"Friday, April 27. Went this morning to Islington to preach, according
to the appointment of my dear brother in Christ, the Reverend Mr. Stonehouse;
but, in the midst of the prayers, the churchwarden came, demanding
me to produce my license, or otherwise he forbad my preaching in that
pulpit. I believe I might have insisted upon my right to preach, being in
priest's orders, and having the presentation of the living at Savannah,
which is in the Bishop of London's diocese,&mdash;a stronger license than that
implicit one by which hundreds of the inferior clergy are by his lordship
permitted to preach. However, for the sake of peace, I declined preaching
in the church; but, after the communion service was over, I preached in
the churchyard, being assured my Master now called me out here, as well
as in Bristol.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> God was pleased so to assist me in preaching, and so
wonderfully to affect the hearers, that, I believe, we could have gone singing
of hymns to prison. Let not the adversaries say I have thrust myself out
of their synagogues. No, they have thrust me out. And since the self-righteous
men of this generation count themselves unworthy, I go out into
the highways and hedges, and compel harlots, publicans, and sinners to
come in, that my Master's house may be filled. They who are sincere
will follow after me to hear the word of God."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus was Whitefield driven to outdoor preaching in
London, as well as in Bristol. Perhaps he would have
preferred a church; but now he must either preach out of
doors, or not at all. His spirit might be vexed, but was not
depressed. On the very day when the imperious churchwarden
thrust him out of Islington Church into the churchyard,
he wrote to his friend Harris at Gloucester:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To-day, my Master, by His providence and Spirit, compelled me to
preach in the churchyard at Islington. To-morrow, I am to repeat that
mad trick, and, on Sunday, to go out into Moorfields. The word of the
Lord runs and is glorified. People's hearts seem quite broken. God
strengthens me exceedingly. I preach till I sweat through and through.
Innumerable blessings does God pour down upon me. Oh that I had a
thankful heart!"</p></blockquote>

<p>When Sunday came, Whitefield, not surprisingly, did more
than he intended. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sunday, April 29. Preached in the morning at Moorfields, to an
exceeding great multitude. At ten, went to Christ Church, and heard
Doctor Trapp preach most virulently against me and my friends, upon
these words, 'Be not righteous over-much: why shouldest thou destroy
thyself?' God gave me great serenity of mind; but, alas! the preacher
was not so calm as I wished him. His sermon was founded upon wrong
suppositions, not to say that there were many direct untruths in it. And
he argued so strenuously against all <em>inward feelings</em>, that he plainly
proved that, with all his learning, he knew nothing yet as he ought to
know. At five, I preached at Kennington Common, about two miles from
London, where thirty thousand people were supposed to be present. The
wind carried my voice to the extremest part of the audience. All stood
attentive, and joined in the Psalm and the Lord's Prayer most regularly.
I scarce ever preached more quietly in any church. The word came with
power. The people were much affected. All agreed it was never seen on
this wise before. I hope a good inroad has been made into the devil's
kingdom this day.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>"Monday, April 30. Declined preaching to-day, that I might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
leisure to write to some of my correspondents, and make preparations for
my poor orphans in Georgia. Heard that Mr. Kinchin had got over his
scruples, and of the wonderful success of my honoured friend Mr. John
Wesley's ministry in Bristol, and of much opposition at Oxford. Certainly
God is about to bring mighty things to pass."</p></blockquote>

<p>So ended this eventful month of April. Wesley, whom
Whitefield had left as his successor, was preaching to thousands
upon thousands in Bristol and its vicinity, and already
numbers were falling on the ground as if "thunderstruck,"
and in the greatest excitement calling upon God for mercy.
Whitefield had prepared Wesley's way in Bristol, and he was
now doing the same in London. Moorfields&mdash;a park laid
out in grass plots, intersected by broad gravel walks, and
shaded by rows of well-grown elms&mdash;was "the city mall."
Kennington Common&mdash;a mile beyond the small hamlet of
Newington, and situated at the end of a vast conglomerated
garden which extended to what is now Westminster Bridge&mdash;was
the rendezvous of London riff-raffs, and the ghostly locale
where hundreds of condemned felons had been hanged
and gibbeted. These, henceforth, were two of Whitefield's
grand cathedrals.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>Doctor Trapp has just been mentioned. This gentleman,
like Whitefield, was born in Gloucestershire, and educated at
Oxford; but he was thirty-six years Whitefield's senior. He
was a culpable pluralist. In 1721, he became vicar of Christ
Church, Newgate Street, and rector of St. Leonard's, Foster
Lane. In 1733, the famous Lord Bolingbroke made him
rector of Harlington, in Middlesex; and, a year later, he was
elected a joint lecturer of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. These
were the church-preferments of the fervent ecclesiastic, who
deemed it his high duty to belabour the poor Methodists.
Turbulence was an element in which Dr. Trapp liked to live.
He had acted as manager for Dr. Sacheverell on his memorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
trial in 1709. Several of his principal publications had
been of a controversial character. There can be no question
that he had a keen relish for a scuffle. He was a man of
extensive learning, and Bishop Pearce pronounced him to be
of all English students the most diligent. His wit was considerable,
but his temper hasty. The one sharpened the other,
and made it more gashing.</p>

<p>The sermon by Trapp, which Whitefield heard in Christ
Church, on Sunday, April 29th, was probably the first of the
series. At all events, the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> announced
that the "fourth and last sermon against Mr. Whitefield and
the Methodists" was "preached on Sunday, May 20th," and
that the sermons were to "be printed at the earnest request
of the audience."<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Trapp, in compliance with "the earnest request" of
his hearers, immediately issued an octavo pamphlet of sixty-nine
pages, with the title, "The Nature, Folly, Sin, and
Danger of being Righteous over-much; with a particular
view to the Doctrines and Practices of certain Modern
Enthusiasts. Being the Substance of Four Discourses lately
preached in the Parish Churches of Christ Church, and St.
Lawrence Jewry, London, and St. Martin's-in-the-Fields,
Westminster. By Joseph Trapp, D.D." Before the end of
the year, the work reached a third edition. A few extracts,
obviously aimed at Whitefield, may be useful.</p>

<p>In a paragraph censuring "ignorant, illiterate people who
presume to expound the Scriptures," the learned Doctor
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Suppose another, though in holy orders, yet a raw novice very lately
initiated into them, shall take upon him, at his first setting out, to execute,
as it were, the office of an apostle,&mdash;to be a teacher, not only of all the laity
in all parts of the kingdom, but of the teachers themselves, the learned
clergy, many of them learned before he was born,&mdash;to reflect upon and
censure them as if they did not know their duty, or would not do it without
being instructed and reproved by <em>him</em>,&mdash;what is this but an outrage upon
common decency and common sense? the height of presumption, confidence,
and self-sufficiency; so ridiculous as to create the greatest
laughter, were it not so deplorable and detestable as to create the
greatest grief and abhorrence; especially if vast multitudes are so sottish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and wicked too, as, in a tumultuous manner, to run madding after him?
Surely it is shocking and prodigious for so <em>young a son of Levi to take
much upon him</em>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such seems to have been the winding-up of the first
sermon&mdash;the one which Whitefield himself heard in Christ
Church. No wonder Whitefield wrote, "The preacher was
not so calm as I wished him."</p>

<p>The next extract is equally personal and offensive.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is a mighty difference between appearance and reality. There
is often the deepest pride where there is no high or lofty look, and the
height of confidence and self-sufficiency under the guise of the greatest
modesty. But how shall we <em>distinguish</em>? 'By their fruits ye shall know
them.' A pharisaical ostentation, and outward show of piety, praying, or
singing psalms <em>in the corners of the streets, to be seen of men</em>, is one
undoubted sign of pride, and that the worst sort of it&mdash;<em>spiritual pride</em>.
Again, he is proud who 'exercises himself in great matters which are too
high for him,'&mdash;who pretends to be more than ordinarily knowing in things
which he knows nothing of,&mdash;who peremptorily censures his betters, and
takes upon him to teach his teachers. All this is contrary to the <em>spirit</em>
and genius of the Gospel, to the <em>modesty</em> and <em>humility</em> of the Christian
religion. These are indications of the worst sort of pride; or if not pride,
it is a <em>folly</em> that approaches very near to <em>madness</em>."</p></blockquote>

<p>In reference to the Moravian and other Religious Societies,
in whose meetings Whitefield so frequently expounded, the
zealous, censorious preacher says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Church itself is, by these irregular, upstart <em>Societies</em>, even by the
<em>best</em> of them, and much more by the <em>worst</em>, greatly weakened and impaired.
For though they do constantly attend divine service, as prescribed in the
public offices, yet I appeal to all <em>discerning</em> and <em>judicious</em> persons, whether,
<em>in the nature of things</em>, they are not likely to set a greater value upon
<em>their own particular meetings and exercises</em>, set up purely by their own
fancies, and commanded by no authority of God or man. To be plain, if
what I am informed of these meetings be true, they are schismatical, in
their <em>tendency</em> at least, though not so designed; for there may be a schism
<em>in</em> the Church, as well as a schism <em>from</em> the Church. If it be true that
they consist of considerable numbers, that they have prayers (some, too,
extemporary ones), and preaching, or something like it, I do not see how
they can be deemed legal assemblies. The public meetings of Protestant
Dissenters from the Church are tolerated by law, and licensed by authority;
but I never heard that these are either. If they should be, I doubt there
would be more danger <em>to</em> the Church from a kind of half-dissenters <em>in</em>
it, than from those who are total dissenters <em>from</em> it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield's open-air preaching occasioned great disquietude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
to the minister of three churches in London and
one in the country. Dr. Trapp remarks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We have heard of <em>Field-Conventicles</em> in Scotland, among the enthusiasts
of that country; which yet, I think, were there always suppressed by the
authority of Church or State, or both. We have had, in former times,
something of this nature in England, as practised by Brownists, Anabaptists,
Quakers, Ranters, or such like. But for a <em>clergyman of the
Church of England to pray</em> and <em>preach in the fields</em> in the country, or in
the <em>streets</em> in the city, is <em>perfectly new</em>; never heard of before; a <em>fresh
honour</em> to the <em>blessed age</em>, in which <em>we</em> have the happiness to live. To
pray, preach, and sing psalms in the streets and fields is worse, if
possible, than <em>intruding into pulpits</em> by downright <em>violence</em> and <em>breach of
the peace</em>; and then <em>denying</em> the plain fact with the most <em>infamous prevarication</em>.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
I could say much here; but am quite <em>ashamed</em> to speak
upon a subject which is a <em>shame</em> and <em>reproach</em>, not only to our <em>Church</em> and
<em>country</em>, but to <em>human nature</em> itself. Can it promote the Christian
religion, to turn it into riot, tumult, and confusion?&mdash;to make it ridiculous
and contemptible, and expose it to the scorn and scoffs of infidels and
atheists? If it be alleged, as I think it is, that Christ and His apostles
prayed and preached in the fields, on mountains, and on the sea-shore,&mdash;I
ask, Have these creatures the same spirit and power that they had? Is
Christianity now in its infancy, as it was then? Was the Church then
established as it is now? Are we now to be converted to Christianity,
from Judaism or heathenism, as people were in those days? Or if
we were, are such false and spurious apostles as these able to convert us?
I might here very properly urge the <em>canons</em> of the Church of England,
and the <em>laws</em> of the civil state. But the thing, though detestable and of
most pernicious tendency, is, in another view, too contemptible to be
longer insisted upon. It would likewise be endless, as well as nauseous,
to make reflections upon that rhapsody of madness, spiritual pride, and
little less than blasphemy, if not quite so, which this <em>field preacher</em> calls his
<em>Journal</em>; and so I say no more of it. Go not after these impostors and
seducers; but shun them as you would the plague. Those who run after
them are the <em>enemies</em> of our <em>religion</em> and Church. These <em>Protestant
enthusiasts</em>, with all <em>Protestant heretics, schismaticks, and false teachers</em>,
on the one hand; and the <em>free-thinkers, infidels, deists, and atheists</em>, on
the other, are doing the work of <em>Papists</em> for them, to their hearts' desire."</p></blockquote>

<p>In this fit of nausea and disgust Dr. Trapp might be
dismissed; but, before parting with him, another of his
virulent outpourings must be noticed.</p>

<p>Three months later in the year, the following was published:&mdash;"The
Nature, Usefulness, and Regulation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Religious Zeal. A Sermon preached at St. Mary's, Oxon;
before the Right Honourable Mr. Justice Fortescue Aland
and Mr. Baron Thompson; and before the University of
Oxford; at the Assizes held there, on Thursday, August
2nd, 1739. By Joseph Trapp, D.D., Minister of Christ
Church and St. Leonard's, Foster Lane, London. Published
at the desire of the Judges and the Vice-Chancellor."
(8vo. 32 pp.)</p>

<p>One extract from this highly patronized sermon must
suffice.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No false zeal is more abusive than that of our <em>modern infidels</em>, on the
one hand, and our <em>modern enthusiasts</em>, pretending to be the <em>only true
believers</em>, on the other: <em>Christianity</em> and <em>Christians</em> by the <em>former</em>, and
our <em>Established Church</em> and <em>clergy</em> by <em>both</em>; being outraged with such
virulence and malice, such insolence and contempt, as was never heard of
before; and would not be endured by any Christian <em>nation</em> under heaven,
but <em>this</em> in which we live. Some <em>emotion</em> in the affections, and in the
blood and spirits, is both becoming and useful; but rage and fury is
neither. The good Christian may have, and should have, some warmth
and even heat; but not be like a red-hot iron, hissing and sparkling from
the forge, and dropping fire wherever it reaches. A brisk gale at sea is
one thing, but a storm is another. Let false zealots be like raging waves
of the sea, foaming out their own shame; but let the truly zealous
Christian carefully avoid these exorbitances. Let Popery and Protestant
enthusiasm, infidelity, and atheism, all leagued against Christianity in
general and the Church of <em>England</em> in particular, rage like a possessed
pythoness; but let every good Christian know and consider <em>what manner
of spirit he is of</em>, which is not such a <em>manner of spirit as that</em>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Public attacks like these were hard to bear; especially in
the case of a young man of twenty-four, ardent, enthusiastic,
ambitious, and somewhat overweening, like Whitefield. In
his sermon on "The Marriage of Cana," Whitefield writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What a sad inference one of our masters of Israel, in a printed
sermon, has lately drawn from this commendation of the bridegroom!
His words are these: 'Our blessed Saviour came eating and drinking,
was present at weddings, and other entertainments; nay, at one of them,
worked a miracle to make wine, when it is plain there had been more
drank than was absolutely necessary for the support of nature; and consequently
something had been indulged to pleasure and cheerfulness.'<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>"I am sorry such words should come from the mouth and pen of
a dignified clergyman of the Church of England. Alas! how is she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
fallen! or, at least, in what danger must her tottering ark be, when such
unhallowed hands are stretched out to support it! Well may I bear
patiently to be styled a blasphemer, and a setter forth of strange
doctrines, when my dear Lord Jesus is thus traduced, and when those
who pretend to preach in His name urge this example to patronise
licentiousness and excess!"</p></blockquote>

<p>A more lengthy and less temperate critique by Whitefield
will be mentioned shortly. Meanwhile, a reply was published
by the Rev. Robert Seagrave, M.A., in an octavo
pamphlet of 32 pages, with the title, "An Answer to the
Reverend Dr. Trapp's four Sermons against Mr. Whitefield,
shewing the Sin and Folly of being Angry over-much."
The title-page also bore the following text from the Apocrypha:
"He was made to reprove our thoughts. He
is grievous unto us even to behold; for His life is not like
other men's; His ways are of another fashion (Wisdom ii.
14, 15)." This pamphlet passed through two editions in
the year 1739.</p>

<p>Mr. Seagrave was born on November 22, 1693, at
Twyford, in Leicestershire, where his father was vicar from
1687 to 1720. At the age of seventeen, he was admitted
sizar of Clare Hall, Cambridge, where he subsequently took
the degrees of B.A. and M.A.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> He heartily sympathised
with Whitefield; and failing to obtain a church, or, perhaps,
not desiring to be the minister of one, he became, in 1739,
a sort of extra parochial clergyman, and occupied the
Lorimers' or Leather-Cutters' Hall, situated at the north
end of Basinghall Street. This hall, for at least forty
years, had been used as a dissenting meeting-house, first
by the Particular Baptists, and next by a Society of Independents.
Here, in 1706, the celebrated Dr. Daniel Neal
was ordained, and officiated as minister, until his increasing
congregation rendered it necessary to remove to a larger
meeting-house in Jewin Street.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>For some years, Mr. Seagrave preached in Lorimers' Hall
with much success. "He was a good minister of Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Christ, a workman who needed not to be ashamed. He
was a man of eminent piety, great humility, and remarkable
zeal and diligence, and very exemplary in the whole of
his conversation. Besides his Answer to Dr. Trapp, he was
the author of "Observations upon the Conduct of the Clergy
in Relation to the Thirty-Nine Articles, with an Essay
towards a Real Protestant Establishment;" also "A Letter
to the People of England;"<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> and likewise "Hymns for
Christian Worship, 1742." He was also the author of about
half a dozen other pamphlets, tracts, and sermons.</p>

<p>Want of space makes it impossible to give an outline
of Mr. Seagrave's reply to Dr. Trapp; but three brief
extracts from this scarce production may be welcome.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Little or nothing was objected to the Methodists, by the clergy, while
they continued <em>in</em> our churches, excepting some disorders and inconveniences
arising, by their means, to our places of worship; but, from the
time they unexpectedly undertook to preach in fields, and in a manner
not altogether favourable to <em>ecclesiastical maxims</em> and <em>church authority</em>,
they have commenced impostors, enthusiasts, and novelists. They have
likewise acquired very additional blame for asserting that they discern
several valuable and worthy Christians amongst Dissenters of every
branch. To which I reply: (1) Does preaching in a field <em>annul</em> that
character or <em>commission</em> of a minister, in all respects ordained like the
rest, which divines themselves call an <em>indelible character</em>? A discovery
seems to be made, that the exercise of a minister's function subsists no
longer than he shall <em>absolutely</em> coincide with the majority of his brethren,
or shall <em>think</em> as his diocesan <em>thinks</em>. (2) The Dissenters have mostly
<em>kept</em> the old truths which <em>now</em> begin to be discovered. Why should we
confine <em>all</em> religion, and <em>all</em> learning, and <em>all</em> knowledge to our <em>own</em>
Church? The Methodists think they see <em>more</em> religion and real knowledge
at present amongst the Dissenters than (I am sorry to say it) is <em>commonly</em>
seen in our own Church; and they have the impartiality not to deny it."</p>

<p>"I shall not deny that instances of folly are imputable to the
Methodists. Persons have sung psalms in streets and corners; an indiscretion
this, but no crime. We ought to balance the <em>bad</em> part with the
<em>good</em>. Nothing but obstinacy and envy can deny that a <em>great</em> reformation
has arisen upon the manners of the age by the <em>itinerant's</em> preaching. If
the gospel be preached in the church, it is well and desirable; but, when
our clergy <em>leave the old truths</em>, and are fallen into the scheme of Deism,
though they may not discern it, men have a right to hear the truth in <em>the
field</em>, or in a <em>meeting-house</em>, supposing they can find it nowhere else."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>One more extract, partly aimed at Dr. Trapp as a
pluralist, must suffice.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Nothing can weaken the credit of any clergy so much as <em>their own
indiscretions</em> and <em>exorbitancy</em> of ambition. When they afford suspicion
of their being lovers of themselves, and negligent of their respective
flocks; when they break the regularity of their own church by <em>pluralities</em>,
<em>dispensations</em>, and <em>other enormities</em>; and, above all, when they are
actually fallen aside from their foundation by <em>departing from their own
constituent articles</em>, a solemn subscription notwithstanding,&mdash;this really
may and ought to weaken and impair, if not the <em>Church</em>, yet certainly the
reputation of such in it, who harbour the present <em>rash</em> and <em>overbearing</em>
principles.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is time to return to Whitefield on the playground
of the London rabble, Kennington Common. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1739, Wednesday, May 2. Preached this evening to above ten
thousand, at Kennington Common, and spent the remainder of the
evening in conference with our brethren in Fetter Lane Society. Our
brethren, who have fallen into errors, have left us voluntarily.</p>

<p>"Thursday, May 3. Preached, at six in the evening, at Kennington,
and great power was amongst us. The audience was more numerous and
silent than yesterday.</p>

<p>"Saturday, May 5. Preached yesterday and to-day at Kennington
Common, to about twenty thousand hearers, who were very much
affected.</p>

<p>"Sunday, May 6. Preached this morning in Moorfields, to about
twenty thousand people, who were very quiet and attentive, and much
affected. Went to public worship morning and evening; and, at six,
preached at Kennington. Such a sight I never saw before. I believe
there were no less than fifty thousand people, near four-score coaches,
besides great numbers of horses. There was an awful silence among the
people. God gave me great enlargement of heart. I continued my
discourse for an hour and a half.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, May 8. Preached in the evening, as usual, on Kennington
Common. Before I set out from town, it rained very hard; but when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
came to the Common, I saw, to my great surprise, above twenty thousand
people. Except for a few moments, the sun shone out upon us; and
I trust the Sun of righteousness arose on some with healing in His
wings.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, May 9. Waited at noon upon the trustees for Georgia.
They received me with the utmost civility, agreed to everything I asked,
and gave a grant of five hundred acres of land, to me and my successors
for ever, for the use of the Orphan House. At night, God enabled me to
preach to about twenty thousand, for above an hour, at Kennington. The
hearers contributed most cheerfully and liberally towards the Orphan
House. I was one of the collectors. It would have delighted any one to
see with what eagerness and cheerfulness the people came up both sides
of the eminence on which I stood, and afterwards to the coach doors, to
throw in their mites. When we came home, we found we had collected
above £47, amongst which were £16 in halfpence.</p>

<p>"Thursday, May 10. Preached at Kennington, but it rained most
part of the day. There were not above ten thousand people, and thirty
coaches.</p>

<p>"Friday, May 11. Preached at Kennington to a larger audience than
last night, and collected £26 15s. 6d. for the Orphan House.</p>

<p>"Saturday, May 12. Agreed to-day, for myself and eleven others, to go
on board the <em>Elizabeth</em>, Captain Allen, to Pennsylvania, where I design to
preach the gospel in my way to Georgia, and to buy provisions for my
Orphan House. Many came to me in the morning, telling me what God
had done for their souls by my preaching in the fields. In the evening, I
preached to about twenty thousand at Kennington. I offered Jesus Christ
to all that could apply Him to their hearts by faith.</p>

<p>"Sunday, May 13. Preached this morning to a prodigious number of
people in Moorfields, and collected for the orphans £52 19s. 6d., above
£20 of which was in halfpence. Indeed, they almost wearied me in
receiving their mites, and they were more than one man could carry home.
Went to public worship twice, and preached in the evening to near sixty
thousand people.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Many went away because they could not hear. After
sermon, I made another collection of £29 17s. 8d.</p>

<p>"Monday, May 14. Spent most of this day in visiting some friends, and
settling my Georgia affairs. Spent the evening very agreeably with several
Quakers. How much comfort do those lose who converse with none but
such as are of their own communion!</p>

<p>"Tuesday, May 15. Preached this evening at Kennington. Notwithstanding
the rain, the people stood very attentive.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, May 16. Sent a Quaker to be baptized by my dear
brother, Mr. Stonehouse. Waited upon the honourable trustees, who still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
treated me with the utmost civility. Dined with some serious Quakers,
and preached at Kennington, and have reason to bless God, more and
more, for the order and devotion of those that come to hear the word.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>"Thursday, May 17. Preached, after several invitations thither, at
Hampstead Heath, about five miles from London. The audience was of
the politer sort. Most were attentive, but some mocked.</p>

<p>"Friday, May 18. Dined with several of the Moravian Church, and
could not avoid admiring their great simplicity, and deep experience in
the inward life. At six, I preached in a very large open place in Shadwell,
being much pressed by many to go thither. I believe there were upwards
of twenty thousand people. At first, through the greatness of the throng,
there was a little hurry; but afterwards all was hushed and silent. Near
£20 was collected for the Orphan House. Received an excellent letter
from Mr. Ralph Erskine, a field-preacher of the Scots Church, a noble
soldier of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"Saturday, May 19. Dined at Clapham with a Quaker. Preached in
the evening at Kennington Common, to about fifteen thousand people, who
were very attentive and affected.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Afterwards, I spent two hours at Fetter
Lane Society, where we had a most useful conference concerning the
necessity of every Christian to have some particular calling, whereby he
may be a useful member of the society to which he belongs. We all agreed
to this. For my own part, I think if a man will not labour, neither ought
he to eat. To be so intent on pursuing the one thing needful, as to
neglect providing for those of our own households, is to be righteous
over-much.</p>

<p>"Sunday, May 20. Went with our brethren of Fetter Lane Society to
St. Paul's, and received the holy sacrament, as a testimony that we adhered
to the Church of England. Preached at Moorfields<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and Kennington
Common, and, at both places, collected near £50 for the Orphan House.
A visible alteration is made in the behaviour of the people; for, though
there were near fifteen thousand in the morning, and double the number
in the afternoon, they were as quiet as though there had not been above
fifty persons present. I did not meet with a moment's interruption. I
could say of the assembly, as Jacob did on another occasion, 'Surely God
is in this place.'"</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>
<p>On Monday, May 21st, Whitefield set out on a short preaching
excursion into the three counties of Hertford, Buckingham,
and Northampton; but, before following him, it may be
useful to pause, and to ponder these marvellous extracts from
the young preacher's Journal. Are they not unique? Is
there any other man, except Whitefield, whose diary, for nineteen
consecutive days, contains a series of statements like the
foregoing? There can be little doubt that Whitefield was
always in danger of over-estimating the number of his hearers.
It is one of the peculiarities of his Journal and letters to say
there were <em>nearly</em> a certain number, rather than to say there
were <em>more</em> than a <em>lower</em> number. But, after making ample
deductions on this account, the crowds attending his ministry
were enormous. Dr. Trapp, during these three weeks, was
doing his utmost, in his three metropolitan churches, to bring
upon Whitefield the ridicule and contempt of the London
populace; but his priestly effort was a failure. The more
Trapp denounced the preacher, the greater were the congregations
that ran to hear him. Dr. Trapp was vigorously
assisted by Dr. Hooker, the conductor of the <cite>Weekly Miscellany</cite>,
which was then the principal newspaper of the Church of
England. On May 5th, one of its columns was filled with
"Queries to Mr. Whitefield," concerning "Principles, Doctrines,
Articles of Faith, Motives, and Extraordinary Light," full of
banter and ridicule. On May 12, nearly two pages of the
comparatively small newspaper were used in denouncing
Whitefield and his proceedings. Speaking of Whitefield, it
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Immediately after his ordination to the <em>priesthood</em>; without a license
from any bishop; contrary to all the rules of the Christian Church; contrary
to the canons and constitutions of our own Church, which so lately
gave him his orders; contrary to the laws of the land,&mdash;he goes strolling
about the kingdom, shewing the greatest contempt for our excellent liturgy,
and all forms of prayer, and using extemporary effusions; preaching doctrines
different from those which he subscribed before the bishop, with an
unparalleled degree of vanity and vainglory; extolling himself, and, with
the most unchristian spirit of censoriousness, undervaluing and blaming
the <em>established</em> clergy."</p></blockquote>

<p>In reference to the immense congregations daily assembled
on Kennington Common, the same article remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"If Whitefield and the Wesleys are permitted to hold their <em>conventicles</em>
at pleasure, and to ramble up and down, singing psalms, and preaching in
the open streets, or in the more open fields, wanton curiosity will carry
thousands to hear them; hundreds of the ignorant multitude will innocently
be corrupted; and the preachers' vanity and enthusiasm, if possible,
will be still more inflamed by a fond imagination that their hearers are all
<em>admirers</em>, whereas most of them would as eagerly attend any other monster
equally as strange as that of a clergyman preaching in a <em>gown</em> and <em>cassock</em>
on a common."</p></blockquote>

<p>On May 26, nearly two pages of the same newspaper
were again filled with virulent abuse of Whitefield. The
following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am told that this unfortunate young man is <em>forced</em> upon this method
of preaching. Hard, indeed, if it be so; but I take it to be much harder
upon <em>us</em> that we must be <em>forced</em> to answer such impertinence. Have the
bishops, from whom alone he ought to take directions, <em>commanded</em> him to
turn <em>mountebank</em>? Is he compelled by military force, or by the violence
of the people, to mount the stage? On the contrary, does he not put out
<em>bills</em> in the daily papers, and invite people to assemble together contrary
to law? I know of no force but an <em>internal</em> one&mdash;an impetuous impulse,
from a degree of <em>pride and vanity</em> that is equalled by nothing but his
weakness and folly."</p></blockquote>

<p>This turbid wrathfulness was far from pleasant; but it
failed in its purpose to put an end to Whitefield's preaching
in the open air, and equally failed in diminishing the
number of Whitefield's hearers. No doubt his action was
irregular; perhaps, also, in his impetuous zeal, he sometimes
indulged in censorious remarks respecting the clergy of the
Established Church. As yet he was not a Dissenter; but
his open connection with the Moravian brotherhood in
Fetter Lane, and his repeated interviews with Quakers,
fairly exposed him to the reasonable suspicion of his enemies,
that he had Dissenting proclivities. He himself seems to
have seen and felt this, and hence the somewhat ostentatious
sacramental attendance at St. Paul's on May 20th. All this
must be conceded; and it must likewise be allowed, that one
of Whitefield's besetting sins, or rather one of his infirmities,
was an unconsciously indulged inflatedness of mind, which
led him (innocently enough on his own part) to the employment
of bombastic expressions, and to the utterance of
sentiments often silly, sometimes fanatical, and generally
such as a more prudent and worldly wise man would not
have used. It would be idle, it would be dishonest, to deny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
that his published Journals abound in such-like faults, though
they have not in the present work been quoted. But what
then? Was it right, was it fair, to treat him with so much
contempt and ridicule? His moral character was without a
speck. His intellect and literary attainments, though not
equal to those of his friend Wesley, made him immensely
superior to scores and hundreds who were enjoying rich
livings in the Established Church. He had no wish to share
their ecclesiastical emoluments, but was quite content with
his mongrel parish among the swamps of far-distant Georgia.
It is true, he desired to have the use of some of their churches,
to which he was not at all entitled; but he desired even this
not for his own benefit, but rather that he might have the
opportunity of proclaiming, trumpet-tongued, some of the
forgotten truths of the word of God, and that he might
collect a little money for the orphans in Georgia. The
clergy had a perfect right to deny him the use of their
churches. Perhaps, being so young a man, it was hardly
modest for him to expect the privilege of using them; but,
having no other place in which to preach, why should he
not be allowed to preach in Kingswood, at Rose Green, on
Hannam Mount, in Moorfields, on Kennington Common, and
Hampstead Heath? His zeal in the cause of Christ, and his
love for the souls of men, were not fictitious. They were
divinely implanted principles, the results of a genuine conversion,
and which ought not to be repressed. Wherever
Whitefield met a man, he met a sinner redeemed by the
sacrificial death of his Divine Redeemer. As yet he had not
become a Calvinist. On Kennington Common, he felt no
restraint in "offering Jesus Christ to all" the thousands
there assembled. Christ had died for them. Whitefield
longed to save them. Why should doctors of divinity, and
the writers of anonymous articles in the Church of England
newspaper, dare to hinder him?</p>

<p>Whitefield has mentioned his collections for the Orphan
House in Georgia; and some, considering the hugeness of
his congregations, may think them scarcely worth recording;
but two other facts must be borne in mind. The age in
which Whitefield lived was not one remarkable for its
charitable contributions; and, further, money then was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
least three or four times more valuable than money now.
Multiply by such a number the amount of Whitefield's
collections, and their comparison with <em>some</em> of the Methodist
collections of the present day will not dishonour them.</p>

<p>It may reasonably be asked, what was there in this
youthful evangelist to draw around him such prodigious
congregations? His warmest friends must admit that he
was far from being perfect. Not only Churchmen, but
Dissenters, saw his faults. It is a curious fact, that Dr.
Doddridge, in some respects the most distinguished Nonconformist
of the age, was present at one of the Kennington
Common meetings which have been already mentioned.
In a letter dated "Epsom, May 24, 1739," he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I saw Mr. Whitefield preaching on Kennington Common, last week,
to an attentive multitude, and heard much of him at Bath; but, supposing
him sincere and in good earnest, I still fancy that he is but a <em>weak</em> man,&mdash;much
too positive, says rash things, and is bold and enthusiastic. I think,
what he says and does comes but little short of an assumption of inspiration
or infallibility."<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In this unfavourable opinion, Dr. Doddridge was not
alone. Dr. Watts, the other great Dissenter then living,
in a letter dated "August 15, 1739," wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I wish Mr. Whitefield would not have risen above any pretences to
the ordinary influences of the Holy Spirit, unless he could have given
some better evidences of it. He has acknowledged to me in conversation
that he knows an impression on his mind to be divine, though he cannot
give me any convincing proofs of it. I said many things to warn him of
the danger of delusion, and to guard him against the irregularities and
imprudences which youth and zeal might lead him into; and told him
plainly that, though I believed him very sincere, and desirous to do good
to souls, yet I was not convinced of any extraordinary call he had to some
parts of his conduct. He seemed to take this free discourse in a very
candid and modest manner."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A witness of another kind may be introduced. Samuel
Johnson was nearly of the same age as Whitefield. Both
had been students in Pembroke College, Oxford. Johnson
was fallible, faulty, and full of personal prejudices; but
he was a man of great ability, and of unblemished truthfulness.
He knew Whitefield, and was not unqualified to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
pronounce an opinion concerning him. That opinion must
be judged by its own merits; but being expressed by a
distinguished contemporary, it deserves attention. Boswell,
Johnson's biographer, writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Of his fellow-collegian, the celebrated Mr. George Whitefield, he
said: 'Whitefield's popularity is chiefly owing to the peculiarity of his
manner. He would be followed by crowds, were he to wear a night-cap
in the pulpit, or were he to preach from a tree."<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> "He never drew
as much attention as a mountebank does; he did not draw attention by
doing better than others, but by doing what was strange. Were Astley
to preach a sermon standing upon his head on a horse's back, he would
collect a multitude to hear him; but no wise man would say he made a
better sermon for that. I never treated Whitefield's ministry with contempt:
I believe he did good. He devoted himself to the lower classes
of mankind, and among them he was of use. But when familiarity and
noise claim the praise due to knowledge, art, and elegance, we must beat
down such pretensions.'"<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Doubtless there is truth in Johnson's opinion, that, one
reason why Whitefield had such crowds to hear him was
because it was a perfect novelty to have a clergyman of the
Church of England preaching, in gown and cassock, in the
open air. It was a further novelty to see such a clergyman
standing up to preach without reading the appointed liturgy
of the Church, and using extemporaneous prayers in lieu of
it. It is also probable that Whitefield created considerable
sensation by employing language such as the clergy in their
churches were not wont to use. All this may be conceded;
and it might likewise be allowed, that, to a large extent,
Dr. Trapp and the editor of the <cite>Weekly Miscellany</cite> defeated
their own purposes, and that, by their virulent attempts
to dishonour Whitefield, they helped to make him more
popular. On the other hand, however, it must be borne
in mind that opinions like those of Doddridge and Watts
were widely entertained both by Churchmen and Dissenters,
and that such a fact was not likely to contribute to the
largeness of Whitefield's congregations. The reasons above
assigned, for Whitefield's popularity, may be perfectly correct,
but they are not complete; for to them must be added the
following: (1) Whatever his faults might be, Whitefield was a
natural orator of the highest order. (2) The truths which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
distinguished his preaching were truths exactly adapted to
the wants and yearnings of human nature,&mdash;such as meet
the necessities of human beings of all classes, in all lands,
and belonging to all ages. (3) Speaking generally, these
truths, until recently, had been forgotten, and were not
preached in the churches and chapels of England. (4)
Whitefield preached them with a fervour which shewed that
he believed them. (5) Above all, in answer to the long-continued
prayers of the Religious Societies, and by the
sovereign grace of God, the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, was
now moving the masses of the people, and making them
anxious concerning their personal salvation; and, further, He
was connecting with Whitefield's ministry a "power from on
high," like that which distinguished the Apostles' ministry
at Pentecost, and making it the means of turning men
"from sin to holiness, and from the power of Satan unto
God." Let the reader ponder such facts as these, and,
perhaps, his wonder will cease at the tens of thousands who
tramped from London to Kennington Common to hear
the unpolished and imperfect sermons of this youthful
Methodist, whose years had not yet reached twenty-five.</p>

<p>While Whitefield was preaching to his large congregations
on Kennington Common and in Moorfields, Wesley was
similarly employed at Bristol and Kingswood. It is a
curious fact that, though Whitefield was forbidden to preach
in Newgate Prison, Bristol, Wesley was admitted. Another
notable incident must be mentioned. In Bristol and its
neighbourhood, Wesley was daily witnessing the most remarkable
conversions,&mdash;conversions accompanied by those
mysterious convulsions that have perplexed all his biographers.
In London, Whitefield had prodigious congregations,
and his oratorical powers were far greater than
those of his friend Wesley; but where were his conversions?
His congregations were often powerfully affected; and, on
May 12th, he speaks of "many" coming to him, and telling
him "what God had done for their souls by his preaching
in the fields;" but this, in substance, is all that he himself
records. Perhaps this difference in ministerial results may
be accounted for by the fact, that nearly the whole of the
conversions under Wesley's ministry took place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
meetings of the Religious Societies, where united prayer was
always joined to scriptural exposition. On the other hand,
during this month of May, Whitefield devoted himself
almost exclusively to the work of preaching to vast crowds
in the open air, where private spiritual enquiries and united
prayers for penitents were impracticable. Besides, at the
first, Whitefield strongly objected to such conversions as
his friend Wesley was witnessing; and plainly told him
that, though he doubted not that God was in the work, yet
he equally believed the devil was interposing. He wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Were I to give so much encouragement to those convulsions as you
have given, how many would cry out every night? I think it is tempting
God to require such signs."<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield, however, was not without conversions; and
two notable instances must be mentioned here.</p>

<p>Wesley, a few months before he died, said, "Joseph
Humphreys was the first lay preacher that assisted me in
England, in the year 1738."<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Who was Joseph Humphreys?
The following particulars are gleaned from a pamphlet of
forty-four pages, published in 1742, and entitled, "An
Account of Joseph Humphreys' Experience of the Work of
Grace upon his Heart. Bristol: printed by Felix Farley."</p>

<p>Joseph Humphreys was born at Burford, in Oxfordshire,
October 28, 1720, where his father, for nearly thirty years,
was the minister of a Dissenting congregation. Joseph was
educated at a grammar school at Fairford, in Gloucestershire.
His father died in 1733; and being, says Joseph,
"uncommonly zealous in his day both for faith and holiness,
he was almost universally despised both by Church-people
and Dissenters." After his father's death, Joseph was sent
to a school in London, "where young men were trained for
the ministry." At this early period of his life, he had
determined to be a minister, and says, "I used to write sermons
of my own composing, thundering exceedingly against
all <em>unrepenting</em> sinners." "The pupils every evening took
their turns in prayer;" and Joseph thought himself "highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
blessed in having his lot cast with such pious, serious <em>young
men</em>." He was soon shocked, however, by the fact "that
these same young men indulged in light and foolish talking
and jesting, playing at draughts, fives, blindman's buff, hunt
the shoe, and such-like ludicrous games, quite unbecoming
such as professed godliness." By degrees, Joseph grew to
be as light-hearted as the rest, and, without confessing it,
became an infidel. After indulging in a frightful excess
of wickedness, he again began to be religious; and
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was for joining the Papists, Church-people, and Dissenters of all
denominations in <em>one</em>; I was for reconciling the Arians, Socinians,
Arminians, and Calvinists altogether; I would have had them lay aside
all disputable points, and harmonize in those things wherein they were
all agreed. I liked those men who were for reducing the <em>Christian
Articles</em> to a <em>few</em>; and if any one called the Pope <em>Antichrist</em>, I thought
he was very ignorant and uncharitable."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the year 1737, Joseph became a member of the
Independent Church, in London, presided over by the
Rev. Dr. Guyse; but was still unconverted. Notwithstanding
this, however, on June 18, 1738, he began to
preach. Six months afterwards, Whitefield returned to
England, and Humphreys writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"About this time there was great talk of Mr. Whitefield; and, accordingly,
on May 2, 1739, I went to hear him on Kennington Common. I
liked him, because he so affectionately invited poor guilty sinners to come
to Jesus Christ by faith. I afterwards heard him several times. I felt
the power of the Lord to be with him; and was much affected to see the
seriousness and tears of many in the congregations. The flocking of the
multitudes to hear the word made me think and say, 'It was never so
seen in Israel.' One evening, as I was coming home from hearing him,
I wept exceedingly, thinking what a hearty, pious minister he was (though
educated at such a wicked place as Oxford) in comparison of what any of
us at our academy were like to be. I earnestly sought his acquaintance;
and, accordingly, one evening I supped with him and Mr. Howell Harris,
and several more brethren, at a public-house on Blackheath, just after his
preaching to a most numerous congregation. The <em>public-house</em> seemed
to be turned into a <em>church</em>; and to me it was like heaven upon earth.
One Sabbath-day, I think it was June 3, as we were singing a hymn at
the academy, I had such a taste of the dying love of Christ as I never had
before. My heart was quite melted, and my eyes were a fountain of tears.
When I came forth, one of the pupils asked me what was the matter with
me? I told him I was <em>happy</em>. When another enquired the same, I
signified that I <em>felt</em> more than I could express."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Humphreys was still a student in the Dissenting Academy
(which had been removed to Deptford), and, though he was
not nineteen years of age, yet, being intended for the
ministry, he began, in the month of the ensuing August, to
preach in "a large dancing room." He had crowded congregations,
and soon formed a Religious Society consisting
of a hundred and forty members. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I insisted chiefly upon a sinner's justification before God, through the
Redeemer's merits; and shewed the nature, necessity, and blessedness of
it. For this, I was soon violently opposed. I became the butt of the
common people; I was <em>singular</em> in the school; was threatened by my
tutor; dropped by most of my old friends; deemed <em>beside myself</em> by
some; and at last, December 25, 1739, was expelled the academy, for no
other crime but this."</p></blockquote>

<p>For about a year, Humphreys found a refuge in the
academy of Mr. J. Eames, in Moorfields; and, while pursuing
his studies, ministered to the Religious Societies of
Deptford, Greenwich, and Ratcliffe. The clergy preached
against him; and two pamphlets were published, which, says
he, "were not worth reading, much less answering."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The rude mob," he writes, "treated both <em>me</em> and the <em>people</em> most
roughly; haling us about, throwing us upon the ground, beating us, and
pelting us with stones or brickbats, rotten eggs, apples, dung, and fireworks.
Officers sent their men to <em>press</em> me. I was hooted at along the
streets; spit upon; called names; threatened, reviled, and belied; hated
of all, and counted the filth of the world, and the offscouring of all things.
I was frequently in danger, not only of having my eyes, but also my
brains, beat out by the large flints that were continually thrown upon the
roof of the barn where I preached."</p></blockquote>

<p>Often while young Humphreys was preaching, numbers of
his hearers were thrown into convulsions similar to those
which occurred under Wesley's ministry at Bristol. Humphreys
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Their bodies were strangely agitated; their bones would sometimes
seem to be out of joint; their breasts would heave prodigiously; some
would bite, tear, and beat themselves, and do mischief to others also,
unless they were forcibly held down; and some would roar hideously,
crying out that the devil was coming to fetch them, or to torment them.
That it was no <em>feigned</em> thing, at least in <em>most</em> of them, is most certain.
That it was occasioned in some by <em>sympathy</em>, I will not deny; but I do
really believe that in others it was occasioned by a <em>discovery</em> of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
<em>undone condition</em>; and was followed by <em>true conversion</em> to the Lord. I
own that the cases of some who were <em>thus affected</em> was so unaccountable,
to this day, I am at a stand to determine <em>how</em> or <em>what</em> it was. For
what I know, they might be <em>torn by the devil</em>. God might suffer Satan
to be let loose upon them for a season; generally, however, it was so
<em>awful</em>, that the beholders durst not make game of it. I only relate matters
of fact; and do not pretend to say that all were <em>renewed</em> or <em>converted</em> who
were <em>thus</em> affected, for I believe no such thing, but the contrary. Neither
could I ever look upon these things as <em>signs</em> from heaven for the establishment
or confirmation of any particular doctrine. I rather think the
case was often this: the word of God would come with a convincing
light and power into the consciences of sinners, whereby they were <em>so far</em>
awakened, as to be seized with dreadful terrors. The rebellion of their
natures would be raised; the peace of the strong man armed would be
disturbed; hell within would begin to roar; the devil, that before, being
unmolested, lay quiet in their hearts, would now be stirred up, and be
most outrageously angry, because of this convincing light and power of
the word. Hence, I believe, proceeded some of these agonies of body.
And all this might be, and perhaps frequently was, without any real
change of heart; for I depend upon no such things as proofs of a person's
conversion to God. Rather let this be made manifest by the fruits of
righteousness, in all gracious tempers and conversation, with perseverance
therein unto the end.</p>

<p>"September 1, 1740. I began to preach at the Foundery in London,
to Mr. Wesley's congregation, and many a powerful opportunity there
was. In the <em>private society</em> also we had many <em>sweet meetings</em>. At this
time, I had a very great intimacy with the Rev. Mr. John Wesley. We
were together almost continually night and day. There were many
things very exemplary in him&mdash;worthy, indeed, of every minister's and
every Christian's imitation. But, on account of some important doctrines
of grace wherein we differed, I was obliged, on April 25, 1741, to separate
from him.</p></blockquote>

<p>Space forbids further details respecting Joseph Humphreys.
Suffice it to say that, in the month of May, 1741, he joined
himself to Whitefield, and acted as one of his itinerant
preachers. Such he was in the twenty-first year of his age.
In the pamphlet, from which these facts are taken, he
declares himself a Dissenter. In some respects, he was a
remarkable man; and the reader will meet with him again.
The following is Wesley's summary of his life:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1790. September 9. I read over the experience of Joseph Humphreys,
the first lay teacher that assisted me in England, in the year
1738. From his own mouth, I learn that he was perfected in love, and so
continued for at least a twelvemonth. Afterwards, he turned Calvinist,
and joined Mr. Whitefield, and published an invective against my brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and me in the newspaper. In a while, he renounced Mr. Whitefield, and
was ordained a Presbyterian minister. At last he received Episcopal
ordination. He then scoffed at inward religion, and when reminded of
his own experience, replied, 'That was one of the foolish things which I
wrote in the time of my madness.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>At the risk of wearying the reader, another of Whitefield's
converts, belonging to this period, must be introduced.</p>

<p>Joseph Periam was the son of respectable parents, who
appear to have resided at Bethnal Green. Joseph had been
articled to an attorney, and intended to devote himself to
the legal profession. He read Whitefield's sermon on the
New Birth, and was converted. The change in him was so
great, that his father and friends thought him mad. The
"symptoms" or proofs of his madness were three. 1. He
had fasted for a fortnight. 2. He had prayed loud enough
to be heard all over a house four storeys high. 3. He had
sold his clothes and given the money to the poor. The first
of these allegations was probably a fact exaggerated. The
second, in all likelihood, was perfectly correct. The third
also was literally true; for, says Whitefield,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Joseph ingenuously confessed to me, that, under his first awakenings, he
was one day reading the story of the young man whom our Lord commanded
to sell all he had, and to give to the poor, and, thinking it must
be taken in the literal sense, out of love, to Jesus Christ, he sold his clothes,
and gave the money to the poor."</p></blockquote>

<p>For such reasons, Joseph Periam was put into the general
receptacle of all London lunatics&mdash;Bethlehem Hospital; an
old edifice founded in 1547, and standing in St. George's
Fields, Lambeth. The institution was a disgrace to all
connected with it. The miserable inmates were treated
most brutally. Their terrible affliction was turned into
pecuniary profit, and the hospital received about £400 a
year, in the form of fees, collected by exhibiting the poor
maniacs, chiefly naked, and uniformly chained to the walls
of their respective dungeons. The practice of entertaining
the outside public by thus shewing the inside patients of
this infernal prison house was not abolished until the year
1770; and, even then, the abolition was unaccompanied
by any other improvement of the usage of the unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
sufferers.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> If men were not mad when they entered, there
was enough to make them mad before they left.</p>

<p>Joseph Periam became the occupant of No. 50 in this
dismal dungeon, miscalled an hospital. "His room," says
Whitefield, "was a cold place, without windows, and had a
damp cellar under it." On entering, Joseph's first refection
was a dose of physic. Whitefield writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Being sensible that he wanted no physic, Joseph was unwilling at first
to take it; upon which four or five men took hold of him, cursed him
most heartily, put a key into his mouth, threw him upon the bed, and
said, 'You are one of Whitefield's gang,' and so drenched him."</p></blockquote>

<p>Poor Periam wrote to Whitefield as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Bethlehem Hospital, No. 50.</span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have read your sermon on the New Birth, and hope I
shall always have a due sense of my dear Redeemer's goodness to me.
May Almighty God bless and preserve you, and prosper your ministerial
function! I wish, sir, I could have some explanatory notes upon the New
Testament, to enlighten the darkness of my understanding, to make me
capable of becoming a good soldier of Jesus Christ; but, above all, I
should like to see you.</p>

<p class="sig">
"I am, dear Sir, yours affectionately with my whole heart,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Joseph Periam</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"According to his request, I paid him a visit, and found him in perfect
health both in body and mind."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 5th of May, 1739, in the midst of his marvellous
services on Kennington Common, Whitefield received another
letter from Periam, stating that he was "surrounded with
nothing but profaneness and wickedness;" that he had to go
into his "cell at seven or eight o'clock at night, and was not
let out till six or seven in the morning;" and that, being
"debarred the use of candles, and consequently books, all
that time, except what was spent in prayer and meditation,
was lost; and though these exercises were good, yet by
constant repetition, and for want of change, they were
deadened." He also asked whether his objections to being thus
"imprisoned were inconsistent or wicked, and whether he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
not, without offence to God, make use of endeavours to be
discharged?" He likewise wished to know whether, being
discharged, he might, "without offence to the gospel of Jesus
Christ, follow the business of an attorney?" And, finally,
the poor fellow asked, "If I cannot be discharged by proper
application, how can I best spend my time to the glory of
God and my own and my brethren's welfare?"</p>

<p>To this lengthened letter, Whitefield sent the following
reply:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<em>May 7, 1739.</em>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The way to salvation is by Jesus Christ, who is the Way,
the Truth, and the Life. The way to Christ is by faith. 'Whosoever liveth
and <em>believeth</em> in me,' says our Lord, 'though he were dead, yet shall he
live.' But this faith, if it is saving faith, will <em>work</em> by love. Come, then,
to Jesus Christ as a poor sinner, and He will make you a rich saint.
This, I think, serves as an answer to your first query.</p>

<p>"It is, no doubt, your duty, whilst you are in the house, to submit to
the rules of it; but, then, you may use all lawful means to get yourself
out. I have just now been with your sister, and will see what can be done
further. <em>Watch and pray.</em></p>

<p>"As for the business of an attorney, I think it unlawful for a Christian;
at least, exceeding dangerous. Avoid it, therefore, and glorify God in some
other station.</p>

<p class="sig">
"I am, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and servant,<br />
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>On May 9, Periam wrote again to Whitefield as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My father was with me last night, when I shewed him your letter. I
told him, I utterly renounced the business, of an attorney. He then asked
me what profession I chose; which I submitted to him, on condition it
might prove agreeable to the will of God. He was pleased to say, he
thought me not mad, but very well in my senses, and would take me out,
if Doctor Monro and the committee were of his opinion. Then he varied
again, and thought it convenient for me to stay the summer, and to take
physic twice a week, fearing a relapse. I told him, as a father, he should
be obeyed; but when, at parting, he mentioned my leaving religion, I
was somewhat stirred in my spirit, and told him nothing should prevail
upon me to leave Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"This is the substance of what passed between us. Upon the whole
matter, sir, God gives me perfect resignation, and, I trust, when He shall
see fit, will discharge me. I find His love daily more and more shed
abroad in my heart. All things will work together for my good. If
opportunity will let you, I should be glad to see you before you set out for
America. May Almighty God, in His infinite goodness, prosper, guide,
and protect you through this transitory life, and hereafter receive you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
triumphantly into the heavenly Jerusalem, there to converse with, and see
the ever-blessed Jesus!"</p>

<p class="sig">
Your loving and sincere friend,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Joseph Periam</span>."
</p>

<p>"Upon reading this," says Whitefield, "I was sensibly touched with a
fellow-feeling of his misery; and, at my request, Mr. Seward and two
more friends waited upon the committee. But, alas! they esteemed my
friends as much mad as the young man, and frankly told them, both I and
my followers were insane. My friend Seward urged the examples of the
young persons, who called the prophet, that was sent to anoint Jehu king,
a mad fellow; of our Lord, whom His own relations, and the scribes and
Pharisees, took to be mad; and of Festus's opinion of St. Paul. He further
urged, that, when young people were under their first awakenings,
they were usually tempted by the devil to run into some extremes. In the
midst of the conference, the committee mentioned Periam's going to
Georgia, and said, if I would take him with me, they would engage that
his father should give leave to have him released. A day or two after,
Mr. Seward waited upon his father, who gave his son an excellent character,
and consented to his going abroad. After this, he waited upon the
doctor, who pronounced him well; and, on May 19th, he waited again
upon the committee, who behaved very civilly, and gave the young man
a discharge. He is now with me, and I hope he will be an instrument of
doing good. The hardships he has endured at Bethlehem will, I hope,
prepare him for what he must undergo abroad."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus was Joseph Periam put into an execrable madhouse;
and thus was he taken out. It is not necessary to trace his
subsequent career; and this apparently long digression will
be pardoned, when it is remembered that, at the time, Periam's
case caused great excitement, and that it occupied a prominent
position in a hostile pamphlet, of ninety-six pages,
entitled "The Life of the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield, by an
Impartial Hand."</p>

<p>It is time to return to Whitefield in London. In the
midst of his unequalled popularity, he wrote to his friend
Harris, of Gloucester, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>May 10, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Harris</span>,&mdash;The hour for my imprisonment is not yet come.
I am not fit as yet to be so highly honoured. God only knows the treachery
of my heart; but, amidst all my late success, I have scarce felt one self-complacent
thought. I speak this to the honour of God's free grace.</p>

<p>"In about three weeks, God willing, we embark for Pennsylvania. The
trustees have granted to me land, and everything upon my own terms.
The officers and general are exceeding kind to my friend Habersham,
upon my account, so that all things succeed beyond my expectations.</p>

<p class="sig">
"Ever, ever yours,<br />
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Whitefield's expectation of sailing so soon was not realized.
On May 21, he left London, and reached Hertford, between
eight and nine o'clock at night. His fame had gone before
him, and, late as was the hour, he preached, on a common
near the town, to four or five thousand hearers. Next
morning, he preached in the same place, to nearly as large a
congregation; then he breakfasted with a Dissenting minister;
and then proceeded to Olney, where he arrived about ten
p.m. Being denied the use of the church pulpit, he, on the
day following, "preached in a field, near the town, to about
two thousand people." At five in the evening, he reached
Northampton, and "was most courteously received by Doctor
Doddrige," the famous Dissenting minister; and, "at seven,
according to appointment, preached, on a common, to about
three thousand hearers." On Thursday, May 24, he "preached
again in the same place, at about eight in the morning, but
to a much larger audience." He then hastened back to
Olney, and, in the midst of an incessant rain, preached
"upon an eminence in the street." At seven in the evening,
he got to Bedford, and says, "I found the town fully alarmed.
About eight, I preached from the stairs of a windmill (the
pulpit of my dear brother and fellow-labourer, Mr. Rogers),<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
to about three thousand people. Friday, May 25, preached
at seven in the morning to rather a larger congregation than
before. Reached Hitchin about one o'clock; and, at two,
got upon a table in the market-place, near the church; but
some were pleased to ring the bells in order to disturb us.
Upon this, we removed into the fields; but, the sun beating
intensely on my head, I became exceedingly sick, and was
obliged, in a short time, to break off. I lay down for about
two hours, and then came and preached near the same place,
and God was with us. It was surprising to see how the
hearts of the people were knit to me. I could have continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
longer with them; but, being under an engagement
to go to St. Albans, I hastened thither, but could not preach
on account of my coming in so late. Great numbers had
been there expecting me; and it grieved me to think how
little I could do for Christ." The people of St. Albans,
however, were not wholly disappointed; for, at seven next
morning, he preached, in a field, to about fifteen hundred
people; and then "got safe to London by two in the afternoon."
In the evening of the same day, his congregation on
Kennington Common numbered "about fifteen thousand."</p>

<p>Thus did Whitefield spend the six days between Sunday,
May 20, and Sunday, May 27. The toil of travelling was
not a trifle; but, besides this, a dozen sermons were delivered,
and all in the open air. Whitefield writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Blessed be God! this has been a week of fat things: many sinners
convicted; and many saints much comforted, and established in their
most holy faith. I find there are some thousands of secret ones yet living
amongst us, who have not bowed the knee to Baal; and this public way
of acting brings them out. It much comforts me, wherever I go, to see
so many of God's children, of all communions, come and wish me good
luck in the name of the Lord. I perceive the people would be everywhere
willing to hear, if the ministers were ready to teach them the truth
as it is in Jesus. Lord, do Thou spirit up more of my dear friends and
fellow-labourers to go out into the highways and hedges, to compel poor
sinners to come in! Amen!"</p></blockquote>

<p>The <cite>Weekly Miscellany</cite>&mdash;the recognized newspaper of the
Church of England&mdash;could not allow even this brief country
excursion to pass unnoticed. On June 2, it had a short
article to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On Tuesday last week, Mr. Whitefield called at Hitchin, on his way to
Bedford, and, at the desire of several Dissenters, was prevailed on to return
there on Friday last, at which time several hundred Dissenters of that
parish, and the neighbouring Dissenters, attended him; but, being denied
the use of the church, he mounted a table in the market-place, on which
the bells were set a-ringing. He afterwards returned to the place of execution,
and, according to his usual method, sung a psalm, and began to
harangue his auditors from, 'We would see Jesus;' but, being overcharged&mdash;&mdash;,
he was obliged to break off abruptly."</p></blockquote>

<p>There can be no doubt, that, not only at Hitchin, but
throughout the whole of this week's tour, the Dissenters were
Whitefield's chief auditors; but the sneer at the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
extract just given, was a foul and filthy falsehood, altogether
unworthy of the Church of England's chief newspaper.</p>

<p>Being returned to London, Whitefield resumed his field-preaching
with as much zest as ever. On Sunday morning,
May 27, he preached, for nearly two hours, "to about twenty
thousand at Moorfields." During the day, he "went twice
to public worship, and received the blessed sacrament." In
the evening, at Kennington Common, he addressed a congregation
of thirty thousand.</p>

<p>The following are extracts from his Journal:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Monday, May 28. Preached, after earnest and frequent invitation, at
Hackney, in a field belonging to Mr. Rudge, to about ten thousand hearers.
I insisted much upon the reasonableness of the doctrine of the new birth,
and the necessity of our receiving the Holy Ghost, in His sanctifying gifts
and graces, as well now as formerly; and I could not help exposing the
impiety of those letter-learned teachers, who say, we are not now to receive
the Holy Ghost, and who count the doctrine of the new birth, enthusiasm.
Out of your own mouths will I condemn you, you wicked blind guides.
Did you not, at the time of ordination, tell the bishop, that you were
inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost, to take upon you the administration
of the Church? Surely, at that time, you acted the crime of Ananias and
Sapphira over again. You lied, not unto man, but, unto God."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus did Whitefield openly attack the clergy of his own
Church; for the Journal containing this was immediately
published, and, before the end of the year 1739, passed
through three editions. No wonder that there were clerical
replies of an angry sort. It was unwise, for so young a
man, to make such assaults; and, in many instances, the
castigations he received were not unmerited. His business
was not to annoy and irritate the clergy; but to preach forgotten
truths, and to convert sinners.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Tuesday, May 29. Went to public service at Westminster Abbey.
Afterwards despatched business for my orphans, and preached, at Kennington,
to a most devout auditory, with much sweetness and power.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, May 30. Waited upon the Bishop of Bristol,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> (who
treated me with the utmost civility,) and received his lordship's benefaction
for Georgia. At the request of many, I preached, in the evening, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Newington Common, to about fifteen thousand people. The word came
with power; and, seeing a great multitude, I thought proper to collect for
the Orphan House; and £16 9s. 4d. were gathered on that occasion.</p>

<p>"Thursday, May 31. I preached at Kennington, to my usual congregation;
and three of my brethren in the ministry were pleased to accompany
me, which filled the people with exceeding great joy.</p>

<p>"Friday, June 1. Dined at Old Ford, and gave a short exhortation to
a few people in a field. In the evening, preached at a place called Mayfair,
near Hyde Park Corner. The congregation, I believe, consisted of
near eighty thousand people. It was, by far, the largest I ever preached
to yet. In the time of my prayer, there was a little noise; but they kept
a deep silence during my whole discourse. A high and very commodious
scaffold was erected for me to stand upon; and God strengthened me to
speak so loud, that most could hear, and so powerfully, that most, I believe,
could feel. All love, all glory be to God through Christ!</p>

<p>"Saturday, June 2. Sent another Quaker to be baptized by Mr. Stonehouse.
Collected, by private contributions, nearly £50 for the orphans.
In the evening, preached at Hackney to about ten thousand; and
£20 12s. 4d. were gathered for the same objects.</p>

<p>"Sunday, June 3. Preached at Moorfields to a larger congregation than
ever, and collected £29 17s. 9d. for the Orphan House. Went twice to
public worship, and received the sacrament. Preached in the evening at
Kennington Common, to the most numerous audience I ever yet saw in
that place, and collected £34 5s."<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This, for the present, was Whitefield's farewell sermon
on Kennington Common. During the last five weeks, he
had preached twenty-one times in this open-air cathedral;
the crowds who had flocked to hear him were marvellous;
upon the whole there had been no disturbances worth mentioning;
God had abundantly blessed the young preachers'
labours; and the services throughout had astonished, not only
Whitefield, but likewise Whitefield's friends and enemies.
The scene, when, on June 3, he took his leave of this
memorable spot, was profoundly affecting. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When I mentioned my departure from them, the people were melted
into tears. Thousands of ejaculations and fervent prayers were poured
out to God on my behalf, which gave me abundant reason to be thankful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
to my dear Master. O what marvellous great kindness has God shewn
me in this great city! Indeed, I have seen the kingdom of God come
with power."</p></blockquote>

<p>At this point, Whitefield concluded his "Journal from his
Arrival at London to his Departure from thence on his way
to Georgia." This, as already stated, was immediately
published. All the important facts in it have been narrated.
Many juvenile reflections on passing occurrences, and imprudent
remarks respecting himself, have been omitted. They
were perfectly artless, and in an <em>unpublished</em> journal would
have been innocent. It is difficult to determine whether
Whitefield did right or wrong by giving his Journals to the
public. No doubt, they were read with the utmost avidity
by his friends; and it can hardly be questioned that they
were, in many instances, the means of arousing slumbering
piety. They are also of essential service to Whitefield's
biographers, and no adequate life of the great preacher can
be written without a liberal use of them. On the other
hand, however, they created enormous prejudices against the
Methodists in general, and, as will soon be seen, brought upon
Whitefield in particular an amount of personal abuse almost
without parallel.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject, it must be added that Whitefield's
two Journals of his "Voyage from London to Savannah
in Georgia," extending from December 28, 1737, to
May 7, 1738, were printed by his injudicious friends, without
his knowledge, in 1738. During the year 1739, three
other Journals were published by himself. 1. The "Journal
from his Arrival at Savannah to his Return to London." (8vo.
38 pp.) 2. His "Journal from his Arrival at London to
his Departure from thence on his Way to Georgia." (8vo. 115
pp.) In both instances the printer was James Hutton, the
Moravian. The title of the last mentioned, however, is not
correct, for (through no fault of his) Whitefield did not
embark for Georgia until ten weeks after he preached his
farewell sermon on Kennington Common. Hence, 3. During
the same year, appeared the following: "A Continuation
of the Reverend Mr. Whitefield's Journal during the Time
he was detained in England by the Embargo." (8vo. 40 pp.)
This extended from June 4 to August 3, 1739; and from it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and from other sources of information the following facts
are gleaned.</p>

<p>It has been already stated that Dr. Trapp's "fourth and
last Sermon against Mr. Whitefield and the Methodists," was
preached on Sunday, May 20. Soon after this, Whitefield
published the following: "A Preservative against unsettled
Notions, and want of Principles, in regard to Righteousness
and Christian Perfection. An explanatory Sermon
on that mistaken text, 'Be not righteous over-much, neither
make thyself over-wise: why shouldest thou destroy
thyself?' Being a more particular Answer to Dr. Trapp's
four Sermons upon the same text than have yet been published.
By George Whitefield, A.B., of Pembroke College,
Oxford. London: printed for G. Whitefield, in the year
1739." (12mo. 33 pp.)</p>

<p>In all respects, this was an unwise publication. Prefixed
to it is a somewhat egotistic and ostentatious address, "To
all the true members of Christ's holy Church," in which
Whitefield says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As the whole of this great nation seems now more than ever in danger
of being hurried into one or other of these equally pernicious extremes&mdash;irreligion
or fanaticism&mdash;I thought myself more than ordinarily obliged to
rouse your, perhaps, drowsy vigilance, by warning you of the nearness of
your peril. Take the friendly caution I give you in good part, and endeavour
to profit by it. Be mindless of me, and attend wholly to the saving
truths I here deliver to you from the mouth of God Himself. Of this only
be persuaded, that they are uttered by one who has your eternal salvation
as much at heart as his own."</p></blockquote>

<p>The chief faults, however, of this sermonic pamphlet are
its pious, but personal abuse of Dr. Trapp. The minister of
the four churches of St. Leonard's, St. Martin's-in-the-Fields,
Christ Church, and Harlington, merited rebuke; but Whitefield's
epithets and strictures were of greater service to
Dr. Trapp than to the man who wrote them. With all his
faults, Dr. Trapp was a distinguished man. At different
periods of his life, he had been Fellow of Wadham College,
Oxford; in the same college he had been appointed to the
first Birkhead professorship of poetry; he had filled the
office of chaplain to Sir Constantine Phipps, Lord Chancellor
of Ireland; and he had published several poetical and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
works, of one of which the University of Oxford had marked
their approval, by conferring upon him the degree of D.D.
Further, he was now in his sixtieth year, and therefore much
more than twice the age of Whitefield. His attack on young
Whitefield had been fierce, almost savage; Whitefield's
retaliatory attack was what? The reader must judge for
himself. Whitefield writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This earthly-minded minister of a new gospel has taken a text which
seems to favour his naughty purpose of weaning the well-disposed little
ones of Christ from that perfect purity of heart and spirit which is necessary
to all such as mean to live in our Lord Jesus. O Lord, what shall
become of the flock when their shepherds betray them into the hands of
the ravenous wolf! when a minister of Thy word perverts it to overthrow
Thy kingdom, and to destroy Scripture with Scripture! Solomon, in the
person of a desponding, ignorant, indolent liver, says to the man of
righteousness: 'Be not righteous over-much, neither make thyself over-wise.
Why shouldest thou destroy thyself?' But must my poor, angry,
over-sighted brother Trapp, therefore, personate a character so unbecoming
his function, merely to overthrow the express injunction of the
Lord to us, which obliges us never to give over pursuing and thirsting
after the perfect righteousness of Christ till we rest in Him? Father,
forgive him, for he knows not what he says! Oh, what advantage might
not Satan gain over the elect, if the false construction put upon this text
by that unseeing teacher should prevail! Yet though he blushes not to
assist Satan to bruise our heel, I shall endeavour to bruise the heads of
both, by shewing the genuine sense of the text in question."</p></blockquote>

<p>Having given what he conceives to be "the genuine
sense," Whitefield proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This is the true, genuine sense of the text, and every other sense put
upon it is <em>false</em> and <em>groundless</em>, and wrested rather to pervert than to
explain the truth. O Christian simplicity, whither art thou fled? Why
will not the clergy speak the truth? And why must this false prophet
suffer thy people to believe a lie, because they have held the truth in
unrighteousness? Raise up, I beseech Thee, O Lord, some true pastors,
who may acquaint them with the nature and necessity of perfect righteousness,
and lead them to that love of Christian perfection which the
angry-minded, pleasure-taking Dr. Trapp labours to divert them from, by
teaching that 'all Christians must have to do with some vanities.' Lord,
open his eyes, and touch his heart, and convert him, and all those erring
ministers who 'have seen vain and foolish things for Thy people, and
have not discovered their iniquity to turn away their captivity.' For
'they have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the
way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they
are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink,
they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is not surprising to see a man of this cast of mind making a vain
ostentation of his little superficial acquaintance with the ancient Greeks
and Romans. What is this but acting conformably to his principle, that
<em>all Christians must have to do with some vanities</em>? And shall we wonder
to hear such an one prefer their writings, to those of an apostle; or be
astonished to see him wound the apostle with raillery for wishing to
'know nothing but Jesus Christ, and Him crucified'? No; with him it is
consistency to laugh and reprove you out of the <em>perfection of righteousness</em>,
which, however he may play with terms, is with him the same as being
<em>righteous over-much</em>. What will not men advance who are drunk with
passion, and intoxicated with self-love! To such lengths does the love of
the world hurry these self-fond, merry-making worldlings. What wonder
is it that lovers and strugglers after the <em>perfect righteousness</em> of Christ
should be charged with <em>enthusiasm</em>, with <em>folly</em>, with <em>fanaticism</em> and <em>madness</em>?
Can you be amazed at it, in an age 'when all manner of vice abounds
to a degree almost unheard of'? when 'the land is full of adulterers,'
and when, 'because of swearing, the land mourneth'? Oh, how is the
faithful city become a harlot! Oh, how 'my heart within me is broken!'
Because of the clergy, 'all my bones shake! I am like a drunken man,
and like a man whom wine hath overcome; because of the Lord, and
because of the words of His holiness,' perverted by this deluded clergyman.
When the clergy become teachers of worldly maxims, what can be
expected from the laity?"</p>

<p>"Such is the language which the indolent, earthly-minded, pleasure-taking
clergy of the Church of England use to strengthen the hands of evil-doers.
Such is the doctrine of the letter-learned divine, who has dipped his
pen in gall to decry <em>perfect righteousness</em>. But suffer not yourselves to be
deluded by him. As I have already shewn you, he is grossly (Lord, grant
he was not maliciously!) mistaken in his manner of explaining this
text. He acts the character of a vain libertine, full of self-love and
earthly desires. May I not&mdash;yea, must I not&mdash;warn you, that this man is
an enemy to <em>perfect righteousness</em> in men through Christ Jesus, and therefore
<em>no friend</em> to Christ? Oh that my head were an ocean, and my eyes
fountains of tears, to weep night and day for this poor creature, this hoodwinked
member of the clergy!"</p></blockquote>

<p>This is quite enough. It is a painful task to adduce such
extracts; but it would not be honest to withhold them.
Whitefield's impetuous character, and the immense number
and extreme violence of the publications against him and
against the Methodists in general, cannot be understood
without them. Whitefield's "Answer to Dr. Trapp's Four
Sermons" was unworthy of him. It was an outburst of
petulant irritation, all the more offensive because arrayed in
the garb of piety. It did no good either to Whitefield or
the cause of Christ. It, and similar attacks, to be noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
shortly, brought upon him and his fellow-Methodists an
enormous amount of personal abuse. No doubt, many of
the clergy of the Church of England were "indolent, earthly-minded,
and pleasure-taking;" but this was not the way to
mend them. Whitefield's mission was not to rail against
the clergy, but to convert sinners. The only excuses that
can be made for him are, that he was young; that he was
naturally impetuous and imprudent; that he had been
greatly irritated; and that, perhaps, he was somewhat thrown
off his balance by the unequalled popularity to which he
had attained.</p>

<p>Having taken a formal leave of his congregations on
Kennington Common, Whitefield, on June 4, proceeded to
Blackheath. He writes: There was nearly as large a
congregation as there was at Kennington yesterday. My
discourse was nearly two hours long, and the people were
so melted down, and wept so loud, that they almost drowned
my voice. I could not but cry out, 'Come, ye Pharisees,
come and see the Lord Jesus getting Himself the victory.'"</p>

<p>Next morning, Whitefield preached on Bexley Common,
"to about three hundred people; and, in the evening, near
Woolwich, to several thousands;" and spent the night with
Mr. Delamotte, of Blendon.</p>

<p>On June 6, he did what he had not been allowed to do
for some time past,&mdash;read prayers, and preached in two
churches; in the morning, at Bexley, by invitation of the
vicar, the Rev. Henry Piers; and in the evening, in a
church adjoining Gravesend. "I have no objection," he
writes, "against the excellent Liturgy of our Church, but
highly approve of it, if ministers would lend me their
churches to use it in. If not, let them blame themselves,
that I pray and preach in the fields."</p>

<p>During these three days spent at Blackheath, Blendon,
Bexley, and Gravesend, Whitefield was accompanied by
Charles Wesley, who says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Monday, June 4. I stood by G. Whitefield while he preached on the
mount in Blackheath. The cries of the wounded were heard on every
side. What has Satan gained by turning him out of the churches?</p>

<p>"Tuesday, June 5. I was with him at Blendon. Bowers and Bray"
(two prominent Moravians) "followed us thither, drunk with the spirit of
delusion. George honestly said, 'They were two grand enthusiasts.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wednesday, June 6. Above sixty of the poor people had passed the
night in Mr. Delamotte's barn, singing and rejoicing. I sang and prayed
with them before the door. George's exhortations left them all in tears."</p></blockquote>

<p>These were strange scenes, but want of space forbids
comment.</p>

<p>Charles Wesley returned to London, and had a tussle
with the Moravians. Two men, John Shaw and William
Fish, were insolently zealous. "Shaw pleaded for his spirit
of prophecy;" and accused Charles "with love of preeminence,"
and "with making proselytes twofold more
children of the devil than before." Fish said Charles was
delivered over unto Satan; and both he and Shaw declared
themselves no longer members of the Church of England.
Charles was also greatly annoyed by a mad prophetess, who
had sprung up among the brethren. Whitefield heard of all
this, and wrote as follows to the London Moravians:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Blendon</span>, <em>June 12, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Brethren in Christ</span>,&mdash;I am jealous over you with a godly
jealousy. I find more and more that Satan has desired to have some of
you in particular, that he may sift you as wheat, and, if possible, divide
and separate you all. I hear there is a woman among you, who pretends
to the spirit of prophecy; and, what is more unaccountable, I hear that
Brother B&mdash;&mdash; (Bray?) seems to approve of her. You have great need,
therefore, to try the spirits, whether they be of God. The devil is beginning
to mimic God's work, and is now transforming himself into an angel
of light, in order more effectually to gain his point. I cannot but think
that Brother &mdash;&mdash; is at present under a spirit of delusion. He, as well as
Brother &mdash;&mdash;, I believe, imagines there will be a power given to work
miracles, and that now Christ is coming to reign a thousand years upon
the earth. But what need is there of miracles, such as healing sick
bodies, when we see greater miracles every day done by the power of
God's Word? Why should we tempt God in requiring further signs? As
for our Lord's coming at this time to reign upon the earth, I answer, 'It is
not for us to know the times and seasons, which the Father hath put in
His own power.' That a great work is begun is evident; that it will be
carried on, I doubt not; but how it will end, I know not, neither do I
desire to know. It is sufficient for me to do the work of the day in its
day, and to rest satisfied in this, that all end in God's glory.</p>

<p>"My dear brethren, be not offended at this plainness of speech. I
would all the Lord's servants were prophets; but then, I would not have
people think themselves prophets of the Lord, when they are only enthusiasts.
If Mr. &mdash;&mdash; is actuated by a good spirit, why is he not patient of
reproof? Why does he fly into a passion when contradicted? Why does
he pretend to be infallible, and that God always speaks in him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pure unfeigned love causes me to use this freedom. Many of you
God has worked upon by my ministry, and, therefore, I would not have
you ignorant of Satan's devices. O beware of him at this time. Do not
conceive prejudices against each other. Do not dispute, but love. Purge
out the old leaven from amongst you. Build up each other in your most
holy faith. My dear brethren, I am your common servant in our dear
Lord Jesus,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>This is not the place to detail, at greater length, the
wranglings between the Moravians and the Methodists; but,
after this, with the exception of attending a Moravian love-feast
on June 25, and a Society meeting on August 1,
Whitefield seems to have had no further connection with
the Brethren.</p>

<p>On June 7, Whitefield preached again in the church near
Gravesend, and in Mr. Piers's church at Bexley; and, on
the two following days, at Bexley, Charlton, and Dulwich.
He was invited to Charlton by the Earl and Countess of
Egmont, who entertained him "with the utmost civility."</p>

<p>On June 10, Whitsunday, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Preached with more power than ever, and assisted in administering
the sacrament to about two hundred communicants in Bexley Church.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
Dined, gave thanks, and sang hymns at Mr. Delamotte's. Preached with
great power, in the evening, on Blackheath, to above twenty thousand
people, and collected £16 7s. for the orphans. After sermon, I went to
the <em>Green Man</em>, near the place where I preached, and continued till
midnight instant in prayer, praise, thanksgiving, and Christian communion.
I believe there were fifty or sixty of us in all; and numbers stood by as
spectators. Many of them watched unto prayer and praise all night."</p></blockquote>

<p>This was a unique scene, in a public house, on the night
of Whitsunday; but Whitefield writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I think it every Christian's duty to be particularly careful to glorify
God in places where He is most dishonoured. Some can sing the songs
of the drunkard in public houses; others can spend whole nights in
chambering and wantonness; why should Christians be ashamed to sing
songs of the Lamb, and spend nights in devotion?"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>The sermon preached at Bexley was founded upon John
vii. 37-39, and soon after was published with the following
title: "The Indwelling of the Spirit, the Common Privilege
of all Believers. A Sermon preached at the Parish Church
of Bexley, in Kent, on Whitsunday, 1739. By George
Whitefield, A.B., of Pembroke College, Oxford. London:
printed for C. Whitefield, in the year 1739." (12mo. 26
pp.) Two or three extracts from it will help to convey
an idea of the style of Whitefield's preaching at this important
period of his history, and of his apparent severity
towards the clergy of the Established Church.</p>

<p>Having laid down the doctrine, that the indwelling of
the "Holy Spirit is the common privilege and portion of
believers in all ages," he proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am astonished that any who call themselves members, much more,
that many who are preachers of the Church of England, should dare so
much as open their lips against this. And yet, with grief I speak it,
persons of the Established Church seem to be more generally ignorant of
it than any Dissenters whatsoever. But, good God! my dear brethren,
what have you been doing? How often have your hearts given your lips
the lie! How often have you offered God the sacrifice of fools, and had
your prayers turned into sin, if you approve of, and use our excellent
Church Liturgy, and yet deny the Holy Spirit to be the portion of all
believers! Oh that I had no reason to speak it! but many, who use
our forms, talk and preach against the necessity of receiving the Holy
Ghost now, as well as formerly; and not only so, but cry out against
those who do insist upon it, as <em>madmen</em>, <em>enthusiasts</em>, <em>schismatics</em>, and
<em>underminers</em> of the Established Constitution.</p>

<p>"But you are the schismatics, you are the bane of the Church of
England, who are always crying out, '<em>the temple of the Lord, the temple
of the Lord</em>;' and yet starve the people out of our communion, by feeding
them only with the dry husks of dead morality. We subscribe to our
Articles, and make them serve for a key to get into Church preferment,
and then preach contrary to these very Articles to which we have subscribed.
Far be it from me to charge all the clergy with this hateful
hypocrisy. No, blessed be God! there are some left among us who dare
maintain the doctrines of the Reformation, and preach the truth as it is
in Jesus. But the generality of the clergy are fallen from our Articles,
and do not speak agreeable to them, or to the form of sound words,
delivered in the Scriptures. Woe be unto such blind leaders of the blind!
How can you escape the damnation of hell? Not all your learning (falsely
so called), nor all your preferments, can keep you from the just judgment
of God. Yet a little while, and we all shall appear before the tribunal of
Christ. There, there will I meet you. There Jesus Christ, that great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
shepherd and bishop of souls, shall determine who are the false prophets,
who are the wolves in sheeps' clothing. But I can no more. It is an
unpleasing task to censure any order of men, especially those who are in
the ministry; nor would anything excuse it but necessity; that necessity
which extorted from our Lord Himself so many woes against the scribes
and Pharisees, the letter-learned rulers and teachers of the Jewish Church.
And surely if I could bear to see people perish for lack of knowledge, and
yet be silent towards those who keep from them the key of true knowledge,
the very stones would cry out."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield brought upon himself great opprobrium by
frequently designating the carnal and unconverted man "a
motley mixture of brute and devil." One of the earliest
uses of this strong expression occurs in the sermon from
which the foregoing extract has been selected; and, as
the following is a good specimen of the plain, powerful
language the young preacher used, no excuse is needed for
its insertion.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"O man! whosoever thou art that deniest the doctrine of original sin,
if thy conscience be not scared as with a hot iron, tell me if thou dost not
find thyself, by nature, to be a motley mixture of brute and devil? I
know these terms will stir up the whole Pharisee in thy heart; but stop
a little, and let us reason together. Dost thou not find that, by nature,
thou art prone to pride? Otherwise, wherefore art thou now offended?
Again, dost not thou find in thyself the seeds of malice, revenge, and all
uncharitableness? And what are these but the very tempers of the devil?
Again, do we not all, by nature, suffer ourselves to be led by our natural
appetites, always looking downwards, never looking upwards to that God,
in whom we live, move, and have our being? And what is this but the
very nature of the beasts that perish? Out of thy own heart, therefore,
will I oblige thee to confess, what an inspired apostle has long since told
us, that the whole world, by nature, lies in the wicked one, that is, the
devil; and that we are no better than those whom St. Jude calls <em>brute
beasts</em>; for we have tempers, by nature, that prove to a demonstration
that we are altogether earthly, sensual, and devilish."</p></blockquote>

<p>One more extract must suffice. It presents Whitefield in
another aspect,&mdash;pathetically and lovingly entreating sinners
to be reconciled to God:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When Joseph was called out of the prison-house to Pharaoh's court,
we are told, he stayed some time to prepare himself; but do you come
with all your prison clothes about you. Come, poor, and miserable, and
blind, and naked, as you are; and God will receive you, with open arms, as
He did the prodigal. O let there be joy in heaven over some of you
believing. Let me not go back to my Master, and say, Lord, they will not
believe my report. Believe me, I am willing to go to prison or death for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
you; but I am not willing to go to heaven without you. The love of
Christ constrains me to lift up my voice like a trumpet. My heart is now
full. Out of the abundance of the love which I have for your precious
and immortal souls, my mouth now speaketh. Why should I despair of
any? No, I can despair of no one, when I consider Jesus Christ has had
mercy on such a wretch as I am. However you may think of yourselves,
I know that, by nature, I am but half a devil, and half a beast. The free
grace of Christ prevented me. He saw me in my blood; He passed by;
and said unto me, '<em>Live!</em>' And the same grace, which was sufficient
for me, is sufficient for you also. Come, then, my guilty brethren, come
and believe on the Lord who brought you with His precious blood. Look
up by faith, and see Him whom you have pierced. Behold Him bleeding,
panting, dying. Behold Him with arms stretched out ready to receive
you all."</p></blockquote>

<p>Remembering that these are perfectly fair specimens of
Whitefield's preaching, it is difficult to account for his
enormous popularity. There is no genius, no poetry, no
learning, no elaborate exposition, no profundity of thought,
no embellishment of language, no anecdotes, no dramatic
illustrations. There is much that is familiar, a little that
is coarse, and more of egotism than is seemly in a young
man of twenty-four. But, notwithstanding all this, Whitefield's
popularity was unequalled.</p>

<p>The visit to Blackheath and its neighbourhood&mdash;in all
respects a pleasant one&mdash;extended to nearly a fortnight,
and Whitefield's principal home was the house of Mr.
Delamotte at Blendon. Of course, he preached daily, sometimes
in Mr. Piers's church at Bexley, occasionally at Dulwich,
often at Blackheath, and two or three times to a few
"gentlemen and ladies," in Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;'s house, at Lewisham.
On one occasion, after he had preached in Bexley Church,
he helped to administer the sacrament to nearly three
hundred communicants, most of whom had followed him
from London. Again and again, on Blackheath, his congregations
consisted of twenty thousand people. Here, on
Thursday, June 14, John and Charles Wesley came to see
him. John Wesley had been preaching out of doors, at
Bristol and at Kingswood; but, up to the present, he had
avoided such an ecclesiastical irregularity in London. He
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"June 14. I went with Mr. Whitefield to Blackheath, where were, I
believe, twelve or fourteen thousand people. He a little surprised me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
by desiring me to preach in his stead; which I did (though nature
recoiled) on my favourite subject, 'Jesus Christ, who of God is made
unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.' I was
greatly moved with compassion for the rich that were there, to whom I
made a particular application. Some of them seemed to attend, while
others drove away their coaches from so uncouth a preacher."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield was delighted that Wesley had dared to copy
his example, not only in Bristol, but in London. "I went
to bed," says he, "rejoicing that a fresh inroad was made
into Satan's territories, by Mr. Wesley's following me in
field-preaching as well in London as in Bristol. The Lord
give him ten thousand times more success than He has given
me!"</p>

<p>The step was taken. Three days afterwards, Wesley
began his wondrous outdoor ministry in Moorfields and at
Kennington Common; and, a week after that, urged by
Whitefield, Charles Wesley "broke down the bridge, became
desperate," went forth in the name of Jesus Christ, found
near ten thousand helpless sinners waiting for the word, in
Moorfields, and preached to them from Matt. xi. 28. At
night, on Kennington Common, he "cried to multitudes upon
multitudes, 'Repent ye, and believe the gospel.'" "The
Lord," says high-church Charles, "was my strength, and my
mouth, and my wisdom."</p>

<p>Thus did the three great Methodists become outdoor
preachers. Whitefield was not with his friends on either of
the Sundays when they commenced to preach in Moorfields
and at Kennington. On the first Sunday, June 17, he had
a glorious day among his friends in Kent. He began by
preaching in Bexley Church. Then he assisted in administering
the Lord's supper. Next, he baptized an adult,
twenty-eight years of age. Then he dined with the Delamottes
at Blendon, "and took sweet counsel with many
Christian friends." After this, he "preached to above twenty
thousand people at Blackheath;" and, Sunday though it
was, finished up by again having supper, and holding a meeting
at the Green Man public-house. He writes: "There
were nearly three hundred in the room. I continued in
exhortation and prayer till eleven o'clock, and then retired
to bed, much pleased to think that religion, which had long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
been skulking in corners, and was almost laughed out of the
world, should now begin to appear abroad, and openly shew
herself at noonday."</p>

<p>Thus was Whitefield occupied on the day when Wesley,
for the first time, preached in Moorfields and at Kennington
Common. And what about the ensuing Sunday, June 24,
when Charles Wesley dared to copy John's example?
Whitefield shall tell his own story. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sunday, June 24. Read prayers, and assisted in administering the
sacrament at Bexley Church. Many came from far, and expected to hear
me preach; but the diocesan had been pleased to insist on the vicar's
denying me the pulpit. Whether for just cause, God shall judge at the
last day. If we have done anything worthy of the censures of the Church,
why do not the Right Reverend the Bishops call us to a public account?
If not, why do they not confess and own us? They say it is not regular,
our going out into the highways and hedges, and compelling poor sinners
to come in. We ought not <em>so</em> to beseech them to be reconciled to God.
They desire to know by what authority we preach, and ask, What sign
shewest thou that thou doest these things? Alas! what further sign
would they require? We went not into the fields till we were excluded
the churches. And has not God set His seal to our ministry in an
extraordinary manner? Have not many that were spiritually blind received
their sight? Have not the deaf heard? the lepers been cleansed?
the dead been raised? That these notable miracles have been wrought,
not in our own names, or by our own powers, but in the name and by the
power of Jesus Christ, cannot be denied&mdash;and yet they require a sign!
But verily there shall no other sign be given to this evil and adulterous
generation!</p>

<p>"Preached in the afternoon to about three hundred people, in Justice
Delamotte's yard; and, in the evening, on Blackheath, to upwards of
twenty thousand, on these words, 'And they cast him out.' God grant we
may learn, when we are reviled, not to revile again! When we suffer,
may we threaten not, but commit our souls into the hands of Him that
judgeth righteously! Lord, endue us with the spirit of Thy first martyr,
St. Stephen, that we may pray most earnestly for our very murderers!"</p></blockquote>

<p>The sermon just mentioned was probably the same as one
which was soon after published, with the following title:&mdash;"The
Spirit, Doctrines, and Lives of our Modern Clergy, not
conformable to the Spirit of Christ. A Sermon preached
at Islington and Bexley. By George Whitefield, A.B., of
Pembroke College, Oxford. London: printed for C. Whitefield,
in the year 1739." (12mo. 33 pp.) The text was,
Luke iv. 29, "And they thrust him out of the city."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>Rightly to understand Whitefield's position, a few extracts
from this notable sermon are necessary.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My brethren, if we will live godly, we must suffer persecution. We
must no more expect to go to heaven without being persecuted, than to
be happy without being holy. If you lead godly lives, all the sons of
Belial, all the scribes and Pharisees, will hate you, and have you in reproach.
They will point at you, and cry, 'See, yonder comes another troop of his
followers! There are more of his gang!' You are counted as a parcel
of ignorant people, poor rabble, who are deceived by a vain young upstart
babbler, by a madman, one who is running into enthusiastic notions, and
endeavours to lead all his followers into his mad way of thinking. The
Pharisees may wonder what I mean by talking of persecution in a Christian
country; but, if they had their will, they would as willingly put our feet
in the stocks, shut us up in prison, and take away our lives, as they have
thrust us out of their synagogues. But let not that discourage you from
hearing the word of God; for Jesus Christ can meet us as well in a field,
as between church walls."</p>

<p>"If you were of the world&mdash;if you would conform to the ways, manners,
and customs of the world&mdash;if you would go to a play, or ball, or masquerade,
the world would then love you, because you would be its own.
But, because you despise their polite entertainments, and go to hear a
sermon in the field, and will not run into the same excess of riot as others,
they esteem you as methodically mad, and fit only for Bedlam. If you
would frequent horse-racing, assemblies, and cock-fighting, then you would
be caressed and admired by our gay gentlemen; but your despising these
innocent diversions, (as the world calls them,) makes them esteem you as
a parcel of rabble, of no taste, who are going to destroy yourselves by
being over-righteous. If you would join them in singing the song of the
drunkard, they would think you a good companion; but because you are
for singing hymns, and praising the Lord Jesus Christ, they think you enthusiasts.
Indeed, our polite gentry would like religion very well, if it did
but countenance an assembly, or allow them to read novels, plays, and
romances; if they might go a-visiting on Sundays, or to a play or ball
whenever they pleased. In short, they would like to live a fashionable,
polite life, to take their full swing of pleasures, and go to heaven when
they die. But, if they were to be admitted to heaven without a purification
of heart and life, they would be unhappy there. It would be a hell
to them. Angels and all good men would be esteemed enthusiasts and
madmen. Heaven might be agreeable, if there were the same polite
entertainments there, as they seem so much pleased with here; but there
is never a horse-course or cock-pit all over heaven."</p></blockquote>

<p>The same sermon contains a violent philippic against the
clergy of the Established Church. Whitefield accuses them
of thrusting him out of their churches, and of depriving him
"of the rights and privileges which" he "ought to enjoy."
This was petulance. He had no <em>right</em> to preach in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
men's churches. The clergy might be discourteous in closing
their churches against a young man recently appointed to
the living of Savannah in Georgia; but it is difficult to conceive
how such an act deprived him of his "rights and
privileges." No doubt, many of the clergy were unconverted;
their lives worldly; and their sermons short, jejune, and often
heterodox; but Whitefield's preaching <em>at</em> and <em>against</em> them
was not the best way to make them better. He proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Is it becoming a minister of the Church of England to frequent those
places of polite entertainment, which are condemned by all serious and
good men? Is it not inconsistent with all goodness for ministers to frequent
play-houses, balls, masquerades? Would it not better become them
to visit the poor of their flock, to pray with them, and to examine how it
stands with God and their souls? Would it not be more agreeable to the
temper of the blessed Jesus, to be going about doing good, than going
about setting evil examples? How frequent is it for the poor and illiterate
people to be drawn away more by example than by precept? How frequent
is it for them to say, 'Sure there can be no crime in going to a
play, or to an ale-house,&mdash;no crime in gaming and drinking, when a
minister of our own Church does this.' This is the common talk of poor,
ignorant people, who are too willing to follow the examples of their
teachers. The examples of the generality of the clergy occasion many
persons, committed to their charge, to run to the devil's entertainments.
Good God! are these the men who are charging others with making too
great a noise about religion?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Enough! It is a curious fact that the sermon, from which
these extracts are taken, is not included in Whitefield's
collected works. Perhaps it was wisely omitted. It would
have done no honour to its author, and been no benefit to
its reader. Still it was preached, printed, published, sold,
and read in 1739, and was one of the things which contributed
to bring upon Whitefield and the Methodists the
rage of both the pulpit and the press of that period.</p>

<p>It has been already stated, that, on the same day that this
sermon was delivered on Blackheath, Whitefield also preached
"to about three hundred people in Justice Delamotte's yard."
His text in the "yard" was Hebrews iv. 9. The sermon, or
rather incoherent address, founded upon this scripture, was
likewise published, with the following title: "An Exhortation
to the People of God not to be discouraged in their
way, by the Scoffs and Contempt of Wicked Men. A
Sermon preached in Mr. Delamotte's Yard, at Blendon Hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
near Bexley. By George Whitefield, A.B., of Pembroke
College, Oxford. London: printed for C. Whitefield, in the
year 1739." (12mo. 12 pp.) The general tone of the
"Exhortation" is the same as that of the sermon on Blackheath.
It was an unwise act to commit such productions
to the press; but, being published, they must be noticed.
Under the shadow of the magistrate's mansion, the excited
young orator exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Here we are scoffed and derided; but be not discouraged. Though
we are here the scorn and offscouring of all things, we are as a gazing-stock
to men and angels. They put us out of their synagogues, and look upon
us as persons unfit for their company; but in that rest, which is prepared
for you, we shall be gazed at for our glory, and they be shut out of the
church of saints, and separated from us, whether they will or no, unless
the Lord Jesus Christ, by His free, rich, and sovereign grace, brings them
unto Himself. The letter-learned scribes and Pharisees of the day look
on us as madmen and enthusiasts. They think it strange that we run
not with them into all excess of riot, and speak evil of us because we will
not go to the devil's diversions with them. We cannot go along the street,
but every one is pointing out his finger with scorn, and crying, 'Here
comes another of his followers.' 'What! are you, too, become one of his
disciples?' Let none of these things move you. Though you are thus
treated here, you will have no discouraging company in heaven. You
will have no scoffer there. You will not be counted enthusiasts, madmen,
and rabble there. Undergo a few reproaches here patiently. Do not
revile them again. Let them say what they please of me; the reproaches,
and scorn, and contempt of this world will no ways hurt me, but will
turn upon their own heads. Therefore, I beseech you, do not answer
them again; but leave it to the Lord, who knows what is best for you
and me."</p></blockquote>

<p>During his visit to the Delamotte family at Blendon Hall,
Whitefield had a run into Herts and Essex. His five days'
evangelistic tour was full of incidents. He went to Hertford
at the earnest request of many of the people there.
The "Baptist teacher" of the town sent his horse to
London to bring him. He was visited by Quakers. He
"breakfasted, dined, prayed, and sung hymns with Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;,
a Dissenting minister." He preached thrice, his respective
congregations numbering from three to five thousand people
each.</p>

<p>By invitation, also, he "hasted to Broad-Oaks, about
twenty miles from Hertford." Here a family resided divided
against itself. Some of the family were converted, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
"most violently opposed and persecuted," by others who
were not. The clergyman had been employed by the opponents
to cure the religionists of their madness, and, among
other things, he had preached against them. Whitefield
went to strengthen and to comfort the new converts; and
says, "I spent the most heavenly night I have known for a
long while. We found the sweets of opposition, and rejoiced
greatly in the prospect of suffering for Christ's sake.
I believe the saints of old had never so much comfort as
when they were obliged to shut the doors for fear of the
Jews, and to hide themselves in dens and caves of the earth."</p>

<p>While at Broad-Oaks, Whitefield was visited by William
Delamotte, son of the magistrate residing at Blendon Hall.
William had become a Moravian, and was now a student in
Cambridge University. The following account of him and of
his family will be read with interest. Whitefield writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To increase our satisfaction," at Broad-Oaks, "Mr. Delamotte, a
convert of Mr. Ingham's, came from Cambridge to meet us. He is
scandalously opposed at that University. The students make him a
proverb of reproach, and abuse him in the rudest manner. He has been
forbid coming into one college; and two or three who associate with him
have been threatened by their tutors for keeping him company. And
here I cannot but remark what wonderful mercies God has shewn this
Mr. Delamotte's family. About three or four years ago, God was pleased
to touch the heart of his brother Charles, who, hearing that Mr. Wesley
was going to Georgia, (though his father would have settled him in a very
handsome way,) offered to go abroad with him as a servant. His parents'
consent was asked; but they, and almost all their relations, opposed it
strenuously. However, the young man being resolute, and convinced that
God called him, they at length somewhat consented. He went abroad,
lived with Mr. Wesley, served under him as a son in the gospel, did much
good, and endured great hardships for the sake of Jesus Christ. Behold
how God rewarded him for leaving all. While he was absent, God was
pleased to make use of the ministry of Mr. Ingham and Mr. Charles
Wesley in converting his mother, two sisters, and this young gentleman
at Cambridge; who, I pray God, may stand as a barrier against the profaneness,
debauchery, lukewarmness, and deism of that seat of learning,
and prove both a Barnabas and Boanerges in the Church of England."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield's prayerful anticipations respecting William
Delamotte were scarcely realized. Within four years after
this, the young man died.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>
<p>Whitefield spent two happy nights at Broad-Oaks; and
during the day-time preached twice at Saffron-Walden,
once at Thaxted, and once at Bishop-Stortford. He returned
to the Delamotte's at Blendon in sufficient time to
preach his famous sermon against the clergy on June 24th.</p>

<p>In most, probably in all, of these journeys and open-air
services, Mr. William Seward was Whitefield's companion.
The following extract from a long letter written to the
Rev. Thomas Seward, at Genoa, will be welcome:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Blendon, in Kent</span>, <em>June 16, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and dear Brother</span>,&mdash;By God's providence, we are
not yet embarked for Georgia, so I have had the pleasure of receiving
your kind and well-meant answer. I knew my letter would surprise you.
I should have been surprised myself, had I been in your circumstances.
Before long, I hope we shall all be of one mind. My brother Benjamin
once opposed, as you do; but, blessed be God, he is now become a fool for
Christ's sake.</p>

<p>"On my own behalf, I cannot sufficiently praise God for bringing me
out of that darkness in which you left me, into His marvellous light. I
know you imagined me to be a true Christian before you embarked, and
so I thought myself. But I was almost a stranger to the doctrines of the
Spirit of God, of regeneration, and of justification by faith only; nor do I
remember to have heard any of them preached or explained by our clergy.
I prayed, went to church, and gave alms; but why and wherefore I knew
not. I knew little or nothing of a <em>vital faith in Jesus Christ</em>. I obeyed
God and Christ in part, but not universally. I hated sin, but had not
dominion over it. You say, my dear brother, that 'if a man who believes
in Christ, and obeys God, is not a Christian, what is Christianity?' But
the question is, what this <em>belief</em> may be? Not a bare <em>historical</em> assent to
the truths and facts recorded in the Scripture, (for this is <em>only the faith of
devils</em>,) but a <em>vital faith</em> wrought in the heart by the blessed Spirit of God,
and productive of good works. This is a <em>faith</em> I never fully felt before
Mr. Charles Wesley expounded the seventh of Romans, and I cannot but
always honour him as an instrument in God's hand of shewing me the
true way of salvation by Jesus Christ. You may call this <em>Quakerism</em>, or
what you please; but I know it is the faith which Christ and His apostles
preached.</p>

<p>"You pray, my dear brother, that we may return to the Church of
England. We are not <em>dissenting</em> from it; neither are the Methodists, as
the world, in derision, calls them. They constantly preach up the articles,
collects, homilies, and liturgies of our own Church. But here lies the
truth of the matter. The doctrines of the <em>Reformation</em> have lain a long
while dormant. The generality of our English clergy have sadly fallen
from them. God has raised up some to preach the truth as it is in Jesus,
and as held by our Church. He has set His seal to their ministry. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
have made abundantly more converts than those zealous atheists you
mentioned. The pleasure, preferment-loving clergy envy their success,
and, therefore, are confederate against them. Perhaps you may think this
uncharitable; but I think I speak the truth in Christ.</p>

<p>"I am far from being bigotted to the Methodists, or to Mr. Whitefield in
particular, out of a blind zeal. I will follow him no farther than he
follows Christ. I believe him to be a sincere good minister of Jesus
Christ. You do not seem to think so. Who wants charity, you or
I? 'By their fruits ye shall know them,' says our Lord. Do the other
clergy bring forth such fruit? You seem to reflect on me for going round
the kingdom with such a knight-errant as Whitefield. I wish you had
used milder terms. But, my dear brother, may I not justly turn the tables
upon yourself, and reflect on you for leaving your flock, and travelling
merely for profit, or little else? Perhaps you may answer, you have
committed your flock to the care of a curate. But may I not reply to you,
as St. Bernard did once on a like occasion, 'Will your curate be damned
for you?' Do not charge others with being righteous over-much, before
you can prove you are righteous enough yourself. Return home, my dear
brother; watch diligently that flock committed to your care; catechize
and visit from house to house; live as Christ lived; teach as He taught;
leave off hunting after preferment, and cease to please the polite world;
and then I will think you a proper person to judge whether the Methodists
are enthusiasts or not.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, my dear brother, this seeming severity. Love for God,
love for you, constrains me to use this freedom. Yet a little while, and I
embark for Georgia. I have settled my worldly affairs, and have taken
care of my dear child. God has begun a good work in our house. I
believe He will carry it on. He has given me my brother Benjamin, and
will He not give me my brother Thomas also? I am, your affectionate,
though weak and unworthy brother in Christ,</p>

<p>It has been already stated that, on the 14th of June,
Wesley was with Whitefield on Blackheath, and preached to
Whitefield's congregation. Four days afterwards, Wesley
returned to Bristol, and, a week later, Whitefield addressed to
him the following important letter. The two friends on some
points differed in their opinions. Whitefield disapproved of
the "convulsions" of Wesley's converts in Bristol. And
again, though no Calvinism can be found in any of the
sermons which Whitefield as yet had published, it is evident,
from the subjoined epistle, that already he was inclined to
the predestinarian creed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>June 25, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Honoured Sir</span>,&mdash;I cannot think it right in you to give so much
encouragement to those convulsions which people have been thrown into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
under your ministry. Were I to do so, how many would cry out every
night! I think it is tempting God to require such signs. That there is
something of God in it, I doubt not. But the devil, I believe, does interpose.
I think it will encourage the French Prophets,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> take people from
the written word, and make them depend on visions, convulsions, etc.,
more than on the promises and precepts of the gospel.</p>

<p>"Honoured sir, how could you tell that some who came to you 'were in
a good measure sanctified?' What fruits could be produced in one night's
time? 'By their fruits,' says our Lord, 'shall ye know them.'</p>

<p>"I hear, honoured sir, that you are about to print a sermon against
predestination.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> It shocks me to think of it. What will be the consequences
but controversy? If people ask my opinion, what shall I do?
I have a critical part to act. God enable me to behave aright! Silence
on both sides will be best. It is noised abroad already that there is a
division between you and me, and my heart within me is grieved. Providence
to-morrow calls me to Gloucester. If you will be pleased to come
next week to London, I think, God willing, to stay a few days at Bristol.
Your brother Charles goes to Oxon. I believe we shall be excommunicated
soon. May the Lord enable us to stand fast in the faith, and stir
up your heart to watch over the soul of, honoured sir, your dutiful son and
servant,</p>

"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Wesley did not come to London; but, as will soon be
seen, Whitefield went to Bristol. Meanwhile, the young
Georgian clergyman was one of the most notorious men in
England. Even the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>, in its number
for the month of June, inserted a laudatory poem "on
Mr. Whitefield's preaching," in which Whitefield's sermons
are contrasted with the sermons of the Arians, and wonder is
expressed that the people should object to Whitefield's
doctrines. With indignant feeling the versifier writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No words for such a preacher are too bad;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Enthusiast, babbler, and a fool run mad!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The <cite>Weekly Miscellany</cite> hardly allowed a week to pass
without fulminating its wrath against the open-air preacher.
In the month of May, the Rev. Josiah Tucker,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> a young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
of eight-and-twenty, curate of All Saints', Bristol, but afterwards
a doctor of divinity, and Dean of Gloucester, proposed
three "queries" to Whitefield. In the month of
June, an anonymous friend deigned to answer them. This
increased the young curate's angry indignation, and he
immediately replied, accusing Whitefield of propagating
"blasphemous and enthusiastic notions which struck at the
root of all religion, and made it the jest of those who sat in
the seat of the scornful." He also related, rightly or wrongly,
that "Whitefield, by his friends, prevented the printing of
his" (Tucker's) "queries in the <cite>Bristol Journal</cite>;" and,
instead of replying to them, wrote a letter telling the querist
"very lordly and laconically, 'My motto is, Answer him not
a word.'" Mr. Tucker continues, "He has, likewise, pronounced
sentence against me, 'That while I remain in this
way of thinking, he absolutely despairs of meeting me in
heaven;' and says he can produce two cobblers in Bristol
who know more of true Christianity than all the clergy in
the city put together."</p>

<p>Whitefield had dared to preach at Charlton, in close
proximity to Greenwich, and this aroused Dr. Skerret, who
published a corrective sermon, for the safety of his flock, with
the following title: "The Nature and Proper Evidence of
Regeneration; or, the New and Second Birth: considered
in a Sermon preached in the Parish Churches of East
Greenwich, in the County of Kent, upon Whitsunday, and
St. Peter the Poor, London, on Trinity-Sunday, 1739. By
Ralph Skerret, D.D., Chaplain to the Right Honourable
Henry Earl of Grantham. London, 1739." (8vo, 36 pp.)
In his preface, Dr. Skerret accuses Whitefield and his friends
as "restless deceivers of the people;" as "subtle and
designing men;" and says "they break in upon all relative
duties, and the benefits of social life, by daily assembling
themselves in troops, upon hills and the neighbouring
commons, under a vain pretence of serving God more
acceptably. But all such service is contrary to common
decency, unanimity, and good order, and is a contempt of
the established places of worship in their own parishes."</p>

<p>The celebrated Dr. Byrom met Whitefield in London, at
the end of June; and, in a letter to his wife, observed:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"While we were at Cousin W. Chad's last night, the so much talked
of Mr. Whitefield came in. He stayed about a quarter of an hour and
then took coach to Gloucestershire. I am surprised at the progress which
he has made, to which the weakness of his printing adversaries does not
a little contribute. He had lords, dukes, etc., to hear him at Blackheath,
who gave guineas and half-guineas for his Orphan House. He
does surprising things, and has a great number of followers, both curious
and real. This field-preaching, they say, is got into France, as well as
Germany, England, Scotland, Wales, etc. People are more and more
alarmed at the wonder of it, but none offer to stop it, that I hear of."<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Scraps like these are useful as helping to exhibit young
Whitefield's notoriety. He must now be tracked to the
west of England.</p>

<p>One of the kindest and most faithful friends of Whitefield
and the Wesleys was Mr. Ebenezer Blackwell, a banker
in Lombard Street, London. Mr. Blackwell had already
joined the Methodists; and Whitefield, on arriving at
Cirencester, wrote to him the following characteristic letter,
now for the first time published:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Cirencester</span>, <em>June 27, 1739</em>.<br />
</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Blackwell</span>,&mdash;Last night, God brought us hither in
safety. I have now a few moments' leisure. How can I employ them
better than in writing you? I almost envy you, because, when I left you,
you were sick. Glorious lessons, dear sir, may you learn from such a
visitation. It may remind you of the much greater sickness and disorder
of your soul, and give you an excellent opportunity of retiring in order to
prepare yourself for the buffetings of a ridiculing world. Ere I return, I
expect to hear you are stigmatized, not only in Lombard Street, but, in all
the places round about. For Christ's servants have always been the
world's fools. And, if you will live godly in Christ Jesus, you, even you,
must suffer persecution. But you know in whom you have believed. He
is able and willing to deliver you. Go on, therefore, my dear friend, in
the strength of Christ. Make mention of His righteousness only. Give
Him your heart&mdash;your whole heart. Cleave to Him by faith in His
blood; and then you may bid men and devils defiance. Oh! Mr.
Blackwell, I would not have you a Demas for the world. But away with
all such thoughts. I cannot bear them. Dearest Mr. Blackwell, I am ever
yours in our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>.
</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;My most hearty love to Brother Sparks, Horn, etc."</p></blockquote>

<p>This, probably, was the first Methodist letter received by
the Lombard-street banker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Whitefield's proceedings, during the next few days, are
sketched in the following extracts from his Journal:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Wednesday, June 27. I waited on the minister of Cirencester,
and asked him for the use of his pulpit; but he refused it, because I
had not my letters of orders. Went to public worship at eleven; and
preached to about three thousand people, in a field near the town,
at twelve. Was afterwards visited by several gracious souls of the
Baptist congregation, who brought me five guineas for the Orphan
House. About seven in the evening, I reached Gloucester, and visited
the Society, and expounded for an hour to more people than the room
would contain.</p>

<p>"Thursday, June 28. Preached in the morning to about a thousand
people in my brother's field. Went to public prayers at the cathedral.
Waited upon the bishop, who received me very civilly. Visited some
sick persons in the afternoon. Preached at night to upwards of three
thousand.</p>

<p>"Friday, June 29. Preached in my brother's field in the morning to a
large and very affected congregation. Went to the cathedral service.
Visited some religious friends; and preached to above three thousand
souls in the street at Painswick.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> All was hushed and silent. The Divine
Presence was amongst us.</p>

<p>"Saturday, June 30. Preached in the morning, in the bowling-green at
Stroud, to near two thousand people; and in the evening, at Gloucester,
to a larger and more affected congregation than ever.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus ended another eventful month. On Sunday, July 1,
Whitefield preached not fewer than four times. First, in his
brother's field at Gloucester, at seven o'clock in the morning;
and next at Randwick, a village about seven miles
from Gloucester, where he was allowed to preach, both
forenoon and afternoon, in the parish church. "The church,"
says he, "was quite full, and about two thousand were in the
churchyard, who, by taking down the window behind the
pulpit, had the conveniency of hearing. Many wept sorely."
At the conclusion of the afternoon service, he hastened to
Hampton Common, where, he writes, "To my great surprise,
I found no fewer than twenty thousand, on horseback and
foot, ready to hear me. I spoke with greater freedom than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
I had done all the day before. About twelve at night, I
reached Gloucester, much fresher than when I left it in the
morning."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his hard day's work, Whitefield preached
next morning, in his "brother's field, to a larger audience
than ever." He then went off to Tewkesbury. As soon
as he arrived, four constables, sent by the bailiff of the
town, came either to arrest or frighten him. One of Whitefield's
friends, a lawyer, requested the constables to shew
their warrant. The officious quaternion had no warrant to
exhibit, and hence the lawyer "sent them about their
business;" and Whitefield, notwithstanding their threats,
preached in a field to a congregation of two or three
thousand people. Next morning, the preacher waited upon
the bailiff, and asked him why he had sent the constables,
with their staves, to arrest him. The bailiff threw the
responsibility of his foolish act upon the town council; but
added, that "a certain judge" had threatened to apprehend
Whitefield "as a vagrant," if he dared to preach near the
place where he resided. "The judge," said Whitefield,
"is welcome to do as he pleases; but no magistrate, I conceive,
has power to stop my preaching, even in the streets."
"No, sir," replied the bailiff; "and if you preach here to-morrow,
you shall have the constables to attend you."
"After this," says Whitefield, "I took my leave, telling him
to be careful to appoint constables to attend at the next
horse-races, balls, and assemblies."</p>

<p>From Tewkesbury, Whitefield proceeded to Evesham.
Here again the magistrates threatened to apprehend him if
he "preached within their liberties." Accordingly, to prevent
this, he preached thrice from a wall near Benjamin Seward's
house, his congregations consisting of thousands.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, July 4, after breakfasting with a Quaker,
Whitefield, accompanied by about thirty of his friends, left
Evesham for Pershore, whither he had been invited by the
incumbent, the Rev. Mr. Parks. Having read prayers and
preached in Mr. Parks's church, Whitefield writes: "About
five in the evening, I took an affectionate leave of Evesham
friends, and, in company with about one hundred and twenty
on horseback, went to Tewkesbury, and never saw a town so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
much alarmed. The streets were crowded with people from
all parts. I rode immediately through the town, and preached
to about six thousand hearers in a field, but saw no constables
either to molest or attend on me. Immediately after sermon,
I took horse, and reached Gloucester near midnight."</p>

<p>This was a marvellous scene, in a quiet country town of
between three and four thousand inhabitants. Think of a
cavalcade, numbering more than a hundred persons, with a
young clergyman at their head, riding, on a fine evening in
summer, from ten to twelve miles&mdash;from Evesham to Tewkesbury&mdash;and
all the way making the welkin ring with the
singing of "psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs." No
wonder that Tewkesbury was, if not "alarmed," yet excited;
and no wonder that the Christian equestrians drew after
them a congregation of six thousand people.</p>

<p>Whitefield had preached thrice, and had ridden between
thirty and forty miles, and had not reached Gloucester till
nearly midnight; but, notwithstanding this, he preached
again at Gloucester next morning, and then set out to join
his friend Wesley at Bristol. Arriving in the evening at
Chafford Common, about eight miles from Gloucester, he
found a congregation of more than ten thousand people
awaiting him, and preached to them about two hours, "till it
was nearly dark."</p>

<p>On the following morning, July 6, he resumed his journey;
and, when approaching Bristol, was met by numbers of his
friends. As he entered, the bells of the city were set
a-ringing. "I was received," says he, "as an angel of God;
and, at seven in the evening, preached at Baptist Mills to
about six or seven thousand people."</p>

<p>Three months had elapsed since he left Bristol and Kingswood
to the care of Wesley; and in the interval strange
scenes had been witnessed. Wesley, the high-churchman,
had followed Whitefield's example, by regularly preaching
in the open-air. Under his ministry, large numbers had been
convinced of sin. Many of them had been thrown into
violent convulsions, and not a few had found peace with
God. Wesley had been permitted to preach in Newgate,
from which Whitefield had virtually been expelled. He had
commenced building, in the Horse Fair, Bristol, the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Methodist meeting house. He had conveyed the property
to eleven trustees; but, at Whitefield's remonstrance, and
by mutual consent, the trust deed had been destroyed, and
the management of the building was now entirely in Wesley's
own hands. He had also begun to build the school at
Kingswood, for which, on March 29, Whitefield had made
the first collection; and the site of which, on April 2,
Whitefield had consecrated, by kneeling upon a loose stone,
and praying "that the gates of hell might not prevail against
the colliers' design."</p>

<p>Of course, Wesley met Whitefield, and went with him to
Baptist Mills, where, says the former, "he preached concerning
'the Holy Ghost, which all who believe are to receive;'
not without a just, though severe, censure of those who
preach as if there were no Holy Ghost." Wesley continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Saturday, July 7. I had an opportunity to talk with Mr. Whitefield of
those outward signs which had so often accompanied the inward work of
God. I found his objections were chiefly grounded on gross misrepresentations
of matter of fact. But the next day, he had an opportunity of informing
himself better; for no sooner had he begun, in the application of his
sermon, to invite all sinners to believe in Christ, than four persons sunk
down close to him, almost in the same moment. One of them lay without
either sense or motion. A second trembled exceedingly. A third had
strong convulsions all over his body, but made no noise, unless by groans.
The fourth, equally convulsed, called upon God with strong cries and tears.
From this time, I trust, we shall all suffer God to carry on His own work
in the way that pleaseth Him."</p></blockquote>

<p>So much as it respects Wesley. What did Whitefield
say? He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Saturday, July 7. Settled some affairs concerning our brethren, and
had a useful conversation about many things with my honoured friend
Mr. John Wesley. Dined at my sister's. Preached at Baptist Mills, to
near the same number of people as last night, and found that Bristol had
great reason to bless God for the ministry of Mr. John Wesley. The
congregations I observed to be much more serious and affected than when
I left them; and their loud and repeated Amens, which they put up to
every petition, as well as the exemplariness of their conversation in common
life, plainly shew that they have not received the grace of God in vain.
That good, great good, is done is evident. Either this is done by an evil
or good spirit. If you say by an evil spirit, I answer in our Lord's own
words, 'If Satan be divided against Satan, how can his kingdom stand?'
If by a good Spirit, why do not the clergy and the rest of the Pharisees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
believe our report? It is little less than blasphemy against the Holy Ghost
to impute the great work, that has been in so short a time wrought in this
kingdom, to delusion and the power of the devil."</p></blockquote>

<p>On Sunday, July 8, Whitefield preached thrice&mdash;first, at
the Bowling Green, Bristol, "to about ten thousand people;"
next, at Hannam Mount, to nearly the same number; and,
in the evening, at Rose Green, to about twenty thousand.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, July 10, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Preached yesterday evening, at the Brick-yard, to about eight thousand
people. Dined to-day with my honoured fellow-labourer, Mr. Wesley,
and many other friends, at Two-mile Hill, in Kingswood, and preached
afterwards to several thousand people and colliers, in the school-house,
which has been carried on so successfully, that the roof is ready to be put
up. The design, I think, is good. Old as well as young are to be instructed.
A great and visible alteration is made in the behaviour of the colliers.
Instead of cursing and swearing, they are heard to sing hymns about the
woods; and the rising generation, I hope, will be a generation of Christians.
They seem much affected by the word, and are observed to attend the
churches and societies, when Mr. Wesley is absent from them. Went
immediately after sermon was ended, with Mr. Wesley and several other
friends, to Bath, and preached to about three thousand people. It rained
a little all the while, but the people were patient and attentive. Heard
to-day, also, that the town clerk of Bristol did my brother Wesley and
me the honour to desire the grand jury, at their quarter-sessions, to
present our meetings, and to have the Riot Act read, but they did not
regard him. Nay, one, who was called to serve on the petty jury, offered
to submit to any fine rather than do anything against us; who, he said,
were true servants of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, July 11. Preached" (at Bath) "in the morning, to a
larger audience than last night. Hastened to Bristol, and preached, in
the evening, at Baptist Mills. After this, my brother Wesley and I went
to the Women and Men's Societies, settled some affairs, and united the
two leading Societies together.</p>

<p>"Thursday, July 12. Was busy most of the day in preparing a sermon
for the press, on 'The Indwelling of the Spirit,' which I would recommend
to all. Preached, in the evening, to eight or nine thousand people, in the
Bowling Green.</p>

<p>"Friday, July 13. Preached my farewell sermon, at seven in the morning,
to a weeping audience. My heart was full, and I continued near two
hours in prayer and preaching. The poor people shed many tears, and
sent up thousands of prayers on my behalf. Their mites they most
cheerfully contributed to the school-house at Kingswood. Retired after
sermon to vent my heart, which was ready to burst with a sense of God's
special, distinguishing, repeated mercies."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, for the present, ended Whitefield's ministry in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Bristol, for he was not there again until nearly two years
afterwards. Wesley writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"July 13. In the afternoon, I left Bristol with Mr. Whitefield, in the
midst of heavy rain. But the clouds soon dispersed, so that we had a
fair, calm evening, and a serious congregation at Thornbury."</p></blockquote>

<p>Before following the two friends, an important incident must
be mentioned. The reader has already learned, that, from
the first, good Bishop Benson had been Whitefield's friend;
but, on the day Whitefield left Gloucester for Bristol, he received
a letter from the bishop, "in which," says he, "his
lordship affectionately admonished me, and expressed the
opinion that I ought to preach the Gospel only in the congregation
to which I was lawfully appointed."</p>

<p>To this affectionate admonition, Whitefield returned the
following answer:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Bristol</span>, <em>July 9, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;I thank your lordship for your lordship's kind letter.
My frequent removes from place to place prevented my answering it
sooner.</p>

<p>"I am greatly obliged to your lordship, in that you are pleased to
watch over my soul, and to caution me against acting contrary to the
commission given me at ordination. But, if the commission we then
receive obliges us to preach nowhere but in that parish which is committed
to our care, then all persons act contrary to their commission when they
preach occasionally in any strange place; and, consequently, your lordship
equally offends when you preach out of your own diocese.</p>

<p>"As for inveighing against the clergy, without a cause, I deny the
charge. What I say, I am ready to make good whenever your lordship
pleases. Let those, who bring reports to your lordship about my preaching,
be brought face to face, and I am ready to give them an answer. St.
Paul exhorts Timothy not to receive an accusation against an elder under
two or three witnesses. And even Nicodemus could say, the law suffered
no man to be condemned unheard. I shall only add, that I hope your
lordship will inspect the lives of your other clergy, and censure them for
being <em>over-remiss</em>, as much as you censure me for being <em>over-righteous</em>.
It is their falling from their Articles, and not preaching the truth as it is
in Jesus, that has excited the present zeal of those, whom they, in derision,
call <em>the Methodist preachers</em>.</p>

<p>"Dr. Stebbing's sermon<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> (for which I thank your lordship) confirms
me more and more in my opinion, that I ought to be instant in season<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and out of season; for, to me, he seems to know no more of the true
nature of regeneration than Nicodemus did when he came to Jesus by
night. Your lordship may observe that he does not speak a word of
original sin, or the dreadful consequences of our fall in Adam, upon which
the doctrine of the new birth is entirely founded. No; like other polite
preachers, he seems to think that St. Paul's description of the wickedness
of the heathen is only to be referred to those of past ages: whereas I
affirm, we are all included as much under the guilt and consequences of
sin as they were.</p>

<p>"Again, my lord, the doctor entirely mistakes us when we talk of the
<em>sensible</em> operations of the Holy Ghost. I know not that we use the word
<em>sensible</em>; but, if we do, we do not mean that God's Spirit manifests itself
to our <em>senses</em>, but that it may be perceived by the soul, as really as any
sensible impression made upon the body. Although the operations
of the Spirit of God can no more be accounted for than how the wind
cometh and goeth, yet may they be as easily felt by the soul as the
wind may be felt by the body. My lord, indeed, we speak what we
know.</p>

<p>"But, says the doctor, 'These men have no proof to offer for their
<em>inward</em> manifestations.' What proof, my lord, does the doctor require?
Would he have us raise dead bodies? Have we not done greater things
than these? I speak with all humility. Has not God, by our ministry,
raised many dead souls to a spiritual life? Verily, if men will not believe
the evidence God has given that He sent us, neither would they believe
though one rose from the dead.</p>

<p>"Besides, my lord, the doctor charges us with things we are entire
strangers to,&mdash;such as denying men the use of God's creatures; and
encouraging abstinence and prayer to the neglect of the duties of our
station. Lord, lay not this sin to his charge!</p>

<p>"But, the doctor, and the rest of my reverend brethren, are welcome
to judge me as they please. Yet a little while, and we shall all appear
before the great Shepherd of our souls. There, there, my lord, shall it
be determined who are His true ministers, and who are only wolves in
sheep's clothing. Our Lord, I believe, will not be ashamed to <em>confess us
publicly in that day</em>. I pray God, we all may approve ourselves such
faithful ministers of the New Testament, that we may be able to lift up our
heads with boldness!</p>

<p>"As for declining the work in which I am engaged, my blood runs chill
at the very thought of it. I am as much convinced it is my duty to act as
I do, as I am that the sun shines at noonday. I can foresee the consequences
very well. They have already, in one sense, thrust us out of the
synagogues. By-and-by, they will think it is doing God service to kill
us. But, my lord, if you and the rest of the bishops cast us out, our
great and common Master will take us up. However you may censure
us as evil-doers and disturbers of the peace, yet, if we suffer for our present
way of acting, your lordship, at the great day, will find that we
suffer only for <em>righteousness' sake</em>. In patience, therefore, do I possess
my soul. I will willingly tarry the Lord's leisure. In the meanwhile, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
shall continually bear your lordship's favours upon my heart, and endeavour
to behave, so as to subscribe myself,</p>

<p>"My lord, your lordship's obedient son and obliged servant,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>This was a bold letter to the venerable prelate, who had
always been Whitefield's friend, and who, only six months
before, had admitted him to the orders of a priest. But
to return, let us follow the young evangelist in his wanderings.
He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Saturday, July 14. Preached" (at Thornbury) "at eight this morning,
to an attentive congregation. Breakfasted at a Quaker's, and reached
Gloucester, with my honoured friend, Mr. John Wesley, and some others,
in the afternoon. Went to the cathedral prayers, and afterwards preached
to a congregation a third part larger than I have had in this place before.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield merely mentions the Quaker at Thornbury&mdash;Wesley
gives a more detailed account, and takes the opportunity
of lashing the pretended teachers of the people. He
writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"July 14. We breakfasted" (at Thornbury) "with a Quaker, who had
been brought up in the Church of England; but, being under strong
convictions of inward sin, and applying to several persons for advice, they
all judged him to be under a disorder of body, and gave advice accordingly.
Some Quakers, with whom he met about the same time, told him
it was the hand of God upon his soul; and advised him to seek another
sort of relief than those miserable comforters had recommended. 'Woe
unto you, ye blind leaders of the blind!' How long will ye pervert the
right ways of the Lord? Ye, who tell the mourners in Zion, 'Much
religion hath made you mad!' Ye, who send them, whom God hath
wounded, to the devil for cure; to company, idle books, or diversions!
Thus shall they perish in their iniquity; but their blood shall God require
at your hands."</p></blockquote>

<p>Next morning the two friends parted, not to meet again
until the year 1741, when, unfortunately, there was a rupture
between them, which, hereafter, will demand attention.
Leaving Wesley to preach to assembled thousands in
Gloucester, Whitefield set out for London. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sunday, July 15. Left my honoured friend, Mr. Wesley, to preach
to about seven thousand souls in Gloucester. Preached twice in Randwick
Church, and assisted in administering the sacrament to two hundred
and seventy communicants. In the evening, at Hampton Common, I was
enabled to preach to about twenty thousand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>"July 16. Preached, at noon, at Tedbury, to about four thousand
people. Many, of divers denominations, came to meet me, with whom I
took sweet counsel. Visited, in the afternoon, Mr. O&mdash;&mdash;, a Baptist teacher.
At seven, in the evening, preached to about three thousand people at
Malmesbury. Much opposition had been made, by the Pharisees, against
my coming; and the minister, in particular, had written to the churchwarden
to stop me.</p>

<p>"July 17. Preached to about two thousand, at eight in the morning;
and reached Cirencester at six in the evening. Here also men breathed
out threatenings against me. Numbers came from neighbouring towns.
My congregation was as large again as when I preached here last.</p>

<p>"July 18. Preached at seven in the morning. I stood in the valley,
and the people on an ascent, that formed a most beautiful amphitheatre.
I reached Abingdon about seven in the evening, and preached to several
thousands. Much opposition had been made against my coming. The
landlord, whose house we offered to put up at, genteelly told us he had not
room for us.</p>

<p>"July 19. At the request of several well-disposed people, preached
again this morning, though not to so great a number as before. Reached
Basingstoke about seven at night. Being languid and weary, I lay down
soon after our coming to the inn; but was shortly told the landlord
would not let us stay under his roof. Upon this, I immediately went to
another inn. The people made a mock of both me and my friends, as we
passed along, and fire-rockets were thrown around the door. About
an hour after, I received the following letter, by the hands of the constable,
from the mayor:&mdash;</p>

<p class="sig">
"'<span class="smcap">Basingstoke</span>, <em>July 19, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Being a civil magistrate in this town, I thought it my duty, for
the preservation of the peace, to forbid you, or, at least, dissuade you,
from preaching here. If you persist in it, in all probability it may occasion
a disturbance, which, I think, it is your duty, as a clergyman, as well
as mine, to prevent. If any mischief should ensue, (whatever pretence
you may afterwards make in your own behalf,) I am satisfied it will fall
on your own head, being timely cautioned by me, who am, sir, your most
humble servant,</p>

<p class="sig">
"'<span class="smcap">John Abbot</span>.
</p>

<p>"'P.S.&mdash;The Legislature has wisely made laws for the preservation of
the peace; therefore, I hope no clergyman lives in defiance of them.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus wrote Mr. Abbot, mayor of Basingstoke&mdash;a butcher
by business, but a stickler for peace. Whitefield immediately
answered Mr. Abbot's letter, with a high-sounding courtesy,
more due to Mr. Abbot's mayoralty than to his business:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Honoured Sir</span>,&mdash;I thank you for your kind letter, and I humbly
hope a sense of duty, and not a fear of man, caused you to write it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"If so, give me leave to remind you, honoured sir, that you ought to
be, not only a terror of evil-doers, but a praise to them that do well. I
know of no law against such meetings as mine. If any such law exists,
I believe you will think it your duty, honoured sir, to apprise me of it,
that I may not offend against it. If no law can be produced, I think it
my duty to inform you that you ought to protect an assembly of people
meeting together purely to worship God.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, honoured sir, I hear there is to be an assembly of another
nature. Be pleased to be as careful to have the public peace preserved
at that; and to prevent profane cursing and swearing, and persons bruising
each other's bodies by cudgelling and wrestling. If you do not this, I
shall rise up against you at the great day, and be a swift witness against
your partiality.</p>

<p class="sig">
"I am, honoured sir, your very humble servant,<br />
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Next morning, Whitefield waited upon the magisterial
butcher, to enquire about the law against his preaching.
The mayor was unable to answer the preacher's enquiry, but
said, "Sir, you ought to preach in a church." "So I
would," replied Whitefield, "if your minister would give me
leave." "Sir," said Mr. Abbot, "I believe you have some
sinister ends in view. Why do you go about making a
disturbance?" "I make no disturbance," answered Whitefield.
"It was hard I could not come into your town without
being insulted. It was your business, sir, to wait, and, if
there was any riot in my meetings, then, and not till then,
to interpose." "Sir," continued the zealous mayor, "you
wrote to me about the revel to-day." "Yes," rejoined
Whitefield, "you ought to go, and read the riot act, and put
a stop to it."</p>

<p>Here the mayor and the preacher parted; but the contention
was not ended. On the same day, the angry official,
with a fair amount of scholarship for a man who handled the
cleaver, as well as mace, sent to Whitefield a polished epistle,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Basingstoke</span>, <em>July 20, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,&mdash;I received your extraordinary letter, and could expect no
other from so uncommon a genius.</p>

<p>"I apprehend your meetings to be unlawful, having no toleration to
protect you in it. My apprehension of religion always was, and I hope
always will be, that God is to be worshipped in places consecrated and
set apart for His service; and not in brothels, and places where all manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
of debauchery may have been committed; but how far this is consistent
with your actions, I leave you to judge.</p>

<p>"As for the other assembly you are pleased to mention, 'tis contrary to
my will, having never given my consent to it, nor approved of it, but discouraged
it before your reverendship came to this town; and, if these
cudgellers persist in it, I shall set them upon the same level with you, and
think you all breakers of the public peace. You very well know there
are penal laws against cursing and swearing, and I could wish there were
the same against deceit and hypocrisy.</p>

<p>"Your appearing against me as a swift witness, at the day of judgment,
I must own, is a most terrible thing, and may serve as a bugbear for
children, or people of weak minds; but, believe me, reverend sir, those
disguises will have but little weight amongst men of common understanding.</p>

<p class="sig">
"Yours,<br />
"<span class="smcap">John Abbot</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>To this Whitefield returned the following reply:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">"<span class="smcap">Basingstoke</span>, <em>July 20, 1739</em>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Honoured Sir</span>&mdash;Does Mr. Mayor do well to be angry? Alas!
what evil have I done? I honour you as a magistrate; but, as a minister,
I am obliged to have no respect of persons. Your <em>apprehending</em> my
meetings to be unlawful, does not make them so. There is no need of a
toleration to protect me, when I do not act unconformable to any law,
civil or ecclesiastical. Be pleased to prove that my meetings are schismatical,
seditious, or riotous, and then I will submit.</p>

<p>"But you say they are upon unconsecrated ground. Honoured sir,
give me leave to inform you, that God is not now confined to places.
Where two or three are gathered together in Christ's name, there will
Christ be in the midst of them. The Church, by our ministers in their
prayer before their sermons, is defined to be, not the church walls, but a
congregation of Christian people. Such is mine.</p>

<p>"As for judging me, to my own Master I stand or fall. At His dreadful
tribunal I will meet you; and then you shall see what is in the heart of,
honoured sir, your very humble servant,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Notwithstanding the mayor's fulminated wrath, Whitefield
went into a field, and began to preach. He suffered no
interruption worth mentioning. Returning to the inn, he
"prayed and sung psalms with a few disciples, and then
took his leave." Passing along, however, he saw the "stage
built for the cudgellers and wrestlers, and met divers coming
to the revel." He was already a mile from Basingstoke;
but, "seeing so many souls, for whom Christ died, ready to
perish, and no minister or magistrate to interpose," he at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
once returned, mounted the stage, and began to shew the
wrestlers, and cudgellers, and their friends "the error of their
ways." The boys huzzaed. One of the "cudgellers" struck
him with a cudgel. The crowd thronged and pushed him.
To obtain a hearing was impossible; and, hence, the intrepid
evangelist again set out for London. Perhaps it was well
he did; hence the following from a letter written to him by
a Quaker:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Basingstoke</span>, <em>July 21, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;When I yesterday went up to thy inn, and
found thee just gone, I was sorry that I missed an opportunity of taking
my leave of thee, and of expressing the sense I had of the presence and
power of God with thee, especially in the latter part of thy sermon, and
in thy prayer after it. However, I am truly glad that thou wert preserved
out of the hands of cruel men. Thou heardest of the threatenings of
many; but the malice of some went further. There were ten or twelve
men lying in wait to do thee a private mischief. I know this, by the
testimony of one of these very men, who boasted to me, 'We would have
given him a secret blow, and prevented his making disturbances.'</p>

<p>"O thy noble testimony against the profaneness and vanity of the age!
It rejoiced me not a little. But when thou earnest to the necessity, the
nature, and the rewards of the new birth, thou wert carried beyond
thyself. The fountain of life was opened, and flowed around amongst the
living. I, for one, am a monument of free grace and mercy. O God,
how boundless is Thy love!</p>

<p>"My dear friend, may we finally be received up into the mansions of
glory, there to live with all the righteous generations, and to sing with
them, hallelujahs, glory, and praise, for ever and ever. May the Ancient
of Days keep thee in His arms, direct thee by His Spirit, support, comfort,
and watch over thee, is the fervent prayer of thine in great sincerity,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">J. Portsmouth</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield arrived in London on Saturday, July 21, and,
in the evening of the same day, "preached to upwards
of ten thousand at Kennington Common." During his
absence, Moorfields and Kennington Common had been
supplied by Charles Wesley, and Whitefield writes: "Blessed
be God for what has been done here, since I left London, by
my honoured friend and fellow-labourer, Mr. Charles Wesley.
All love, all glory be to God for giving so great an increase!"</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sunday, July 22. Received a letter from Mr. Ralph Erskine, of
Scotland. Some may be offended at my corresponding with him, but I
dare not but confess my Lord's disciples. Preached, at seven in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
morning, to about twenty thousand in Moorfields, and collected £24 17s.
for the school-house at Kingswood. Ye scoffers, ye blind Pharisees,
come and see, and then call these tumultuous, seditious assemblies, if
you can. Would to God, they behaved so decently in any church
in London! Went to St. Paul's, and received the blessed sacrament.
Preached in the evening, at Kennington Common, to about thirty thousand
hearers, and collected £15 15s. 6d. for the colliers. God gave me great
power, and I never opened my mouth so freely against the letter-learned
clergymen of the Church of England. Every day do I see the necessity
of speaking out more and more. God knows my heart, I do not speak
out of resentment. I heartily wish the Church of England was the joy of
the whole earth; but I cannot see her sinking into papistical ignorance,
and refined Deism, and not open my mouth against those who, by their
sensual, lukewarm lives, and unscriptural, superficial doctrines, thus cause
her to err."</p></blockquote>

<p>Every day Whitefield was becoming more and more a
Dissenter. The Rev. Ralph Erskine was the head of a sect
of Dissenters who had recently seceded from the Church of
Scotland. He and Whitefield were already friendly correspondents.
Erskine's letter to Whitefield (mentioned in the
above extract) is lost, but Whitefield's answer is preserved.
The following is a part of it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>July 23, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Yesterday, with great pleasure, I received
your kind letter. I was afraid lest I should have offended you. If
this should be the case at any time, reprove me sharply, and I shall thank
you with my whole heart. I bless God that my sermons are approved of
by you. I am but a novice in the school of Christ; but my Master
enlightens me more and more every day to know the exceeding great
riches and freedom of His grace to all who believe in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"By this time, I hope you have seen my journal, and have given thanks
for what great things God has done for my soul. An appendix will be
printed shortly. The success of the gospel increases daily. Opposition, also,
increases daily; but as opposition abounds, so does my inward consolation.
A sermon of mine is now being printed, which will disturb the pleasure
of preferment-loving clergy, more than ever. Mr. Wesley has not yet
received your letter. He will readily correspond with you. He fights the
Lord's battles, as doth his brother, most courageously. A noble reformation
is begun among Kingswood colliers, near Bristol. I am now collecting
money for building them a school-house. My tenderest affections await
all the Associate Presbytery.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> I am opposed for owning you; but to deny
our Lord's disciples, in my opinion, is denying Christ Himself. Providence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
detains me here. Pray write, by next post, to, rev. and dear sir, yours

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and very dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have now read your journals
and sermons, and I can assure you, with reference to the whole work in
general, and the main scope of it, my soul has been made to magnify the
Lord for the very great things He has done for you and by you. If I speak
of any things wherein we differ, it shall only be to shew the greatness of
my love to you, and also to prevent after mistakes."</p></blockquote>

<p>Erskine then proceeds to express a hope that there will be
"a happy union in the Lord" between the Oxford Methodists
and the Associate Presbytery, "not only in a private and
personal, but even in a more public and general way." He
affirms, truly enough, that "England's reformation from
Popery, and its superstitious and ceremonial services, however
great and glorious, was far from being so full as that of
Scotland;" and he trusts, that "when a new and general
reformation shall be set on foot, more of the rags of the
Romish Church will be dropped, such as many useless rites
and customs relating to worship, which have no scriptural
foundation."</p>

<p>Erskine next criticises Whitefield's Journal. In reference
to his fellowship with Quakers, the Scotch Reformer says:
"Whatever duties of love you perform towards these men, I
will never believe you mean or intend to justify their principles
and delusive notions."</p>

<p>On the subject of secession, Erskine writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You say that so long as the Articles of the Church of England are
agreeable to Scripture, you resolve to preach them up, without either
bigotry or party zeal. This is the case with us. We preach up and
defend, doctrinally and judicially, those Articles of the Church of Scotland,
agreeable to the Scriptures, which the judicatories are letting go. Hence,
I conclude, you are just of our mind, as to separation from an established
Church. We never declared a secession from the Church of Scotland, but
only a secession from the judicatories, in their course of defection from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the primitive and covenanted constitution, to which we stood bound by
our ordination engagements."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield's sermons are next examined, and objectionable
sentiments and sentences pointed out. Erskine concludes
his long letter thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I see much of the glory and majesty of God, and many of the stately
steps and goings of our mighty king Jesus, in your sermons and journals;
and have, with tears of joy, adored His name for what He is doing for you
and by you. When I consider how you and your brethren are stirred up
of God to such a remarkable way of witnessing for Him in England, against
the corruptions and defections of that Church; and when we of the
Associate Presbytery have been called forth in a judicial way to witness
against the corruptions and defections of the Church of Scotland; and
both at a juncture, when Popish powers are combining together against us,
and desolating judgments are justly threatened from heaven, there is,
perhaps, more in the womb of Providence relating to our several situations,
and successes therein, than we are aware of. What He doth we know not
now, but we may know hereafter.</p>

<p>"We have lately been attending several sacramental solemnities in our
brethren's congregations, where vast multitudes of people were assembled
at the tents without doors, as well as in the church; and I never found
more of the presence of God than on some of these occasions. The Spirit
of God was sometimes remarkably poured out. Enemies gnash with their
teeth, but the Lord carries on His work. My brethren salute you most
affectionately. They love and respect you in the Lord. I salute the worthy
Sewards and Wesleys in the Lord.</p>

<p>"I am, rev. and dear sir, yours most affectionately in our blessed
Immanuel,</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>To return to Whitefield's Journal. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Monday, July 23. Preached this evening at Hackney Marsh, to about
two thousand people. I prayed and discoursed for above two hours, and
with greater demonstration of the Spirit than ever. Every day have I
more and more reason to rejoice in what God has done for my own and
others' souls. Thousands at the great day will have reason to bless God
for field-preaching.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, July 24. Despatched my private affairs, and preached in
the evening at Kennington Common, to about fifteen thousand.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, July 25. Preached this evening at Edmonton. The
congregation was large and attentive, and I rejoiced in having an opportunity
of offering salvation freely to the rich.</p>

<p>"Thursday, July 26. Preached to upwards of ten thousand at Hackney
Marsh, in a field where was to be a horse-race. I had the opportunity
of bearing my testimony against such unchristian entertainments. Very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
few left the sermon to see the race, and some of those soon returned.
By the help of God, I will still go on to attack the devil in his strongest
holds. The common people go to these diversions for want of knowing
better.</p>

<p>"Friday, July 27. Preached at Kennington Common, to my usual
number of hearers. Went to Lewisham.</p>

<p>"Saturday, July 28. Visited the family of Justice Delamotte at Blendon,
where we exhorted and built up each other in the knowledge and fear
of God. Preached at Blackheath in the evening, and came home rejoicing.</p>

<p>"Sunday, July 29. Preached this morning in Moorfields, to a much
larger congregation than we had last Sunday,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> and collected £24 9s.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> for
the school at Kingswood. Received the sacrament at St. Paul's, and
preached at Kennington Common in the evening, where £20 was collected.
God sent us a little rain, but that only washed away the curious hearers.
Nearly thirty thousand stood their ground.</p>

<p>"Monday, July 30. Was busied all the morning in directing those
to believe in Jesus Christ, who came asking me what they should do
to be saved? Preached at Plaistow. An uncommon power was in the
congregation.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, July 31. Preached at Newington, near Hackney, to about
twenty thousand people.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, August 1. Preached this evening at Marylebone Fields,
to near thirty thousand, and went afterwards to take my leave of Fetter
Lane Society. We parted in love.</p>

<p>"Thursday, August 2. Preached at Newington, to upwards of twenty
thousand people, and came home rejoicing to see what a great work God
has done in this city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Friday, August 3. Spent the day in completing my affairs and
taking leave of my dear friends. Preached in the evening, to near twenty
thousand, at Kennington Common. I chose to discourse on St. Paul's
parting speech to the elders at Ephesus, and concluded with a suitable
hymn; but could scarce get to the coach, for the people's thronging me,
to take me by the hand, and give me a parting blessing.</p>

<p>"Saturday, August 4. Went in the morning to Deptford; prayed,
sung psalms, and gave a word of exhortation at two or three houses.
Preached at Blackheath, to about ten thousand, and went to Blendon.</p>

<p>"Sunday, August 5. Expounded, prayed, and sung psalms at Mr.
Delamotte's door, with many who came last night from London. Read
prayers and assisted in administering the sacrament to several hundred
communicants in Bexley Church. Preached in the afternoon, to about
fifteen hundred, in Justice Delamotte's yard; and again in the evening, to
about twenty thousand, at Blackheath.</p>

<p>"Monday, August 6. Preached in the evening at Chatham, to near ten
thousand people.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, August 7. Preached in the evening at Blackheath. It
rained very much the whole day; but there were about two thousand
present. I discoursed on the conversion of Zaccheus the publican.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, August 8. At Deptford, went on board the ship;
which we now hallowed by the word of God, and prayer. Preached at
Blackheath, to near twenty thousand people, on the Pharisee and the
Publican.</p>

<p>"Thursday, August 9. Preached at Blackheath, to a very large congregation,
and went and lay on board the ship, in order to be ready to
finish my affairs in the morning.</p>

<p>"Friday, August 10. Finished my ship business, and preached in the
evening at Blackheath, to a yet greater congregation than ever.</p>

<p>"Saturday, August 11. Began in the spirit of meekness to answer the
Bishop of London's Pastoral Letter. Preached in the evening at Blackheath.</p>

<p>"Sunday, August 12. Preached, early in the morning, to some
hundreds, in Justice Delamotte's yard, most of whom came thither last
night, singing and praising God. Read prayers, heard a truly Christian
sermon from Mr. Piers, and assisted him in administering the blessed
sacrament, in his own church, to near six hundred communicants.
Preached at three in the afternoon, to near three thousand, in Mr. Delamotte's
yard, and to about twenty thousand at Blackheath. At each
place, the people were exceedingly affected; and, at Blackheath, when I
said, 'Finally, brethren, farewell!' thousands immediately burst into
strong crying and tears. I continued my discourse till it was nearly dark,
and collected nearly £15 for Kingswood School.</p>

<p>"Monday, August 13. Finished, and sent to the press, my answer to
his lordship's Pastoral Letter. Rode with many of my dear weeping
friends to Erith; took my final and sorrowful farewell, and went from
thence in a boat, with my dear fellow-travellers to Gravesend, where
our ship was fallen down. Blessed be God for detaining me in England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
by the embargo. Many others, as well as myself, I hope, have reason to
rejoice thereat.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, August 14. About eight last night, got on board the <em>Elizabeth</em>,
Captain Stevenson commander, bound from England to Philadelphia.
After much entreaty, went to Gravesend, and read prayers, and
preached in Mitton Church, near the town. Returned to the ship by eight
in the evening, and was much rejoiced at retiring from the world."</p></blockquote>

<p>And well he might. Eight months had elapsed since his
return from America to England. Strange had been his
history. Unquestionably, it is without a parallel. Much
has been related; but much remains untold. In the above
condensed extracts from his journal, the reader has seen
how Whitefield spent his last few weeks in England. He
was full of joy, thankfulness, and hope; though all the while
most bitterly attacked both by the pulpit and the press.
In his letters he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Matters go on most bravely in London. I think people are ten times
more affected than ever.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> A great work of God is doing here. The Lord
Jesus gets Himself the victory everyday. Free grace compels poor sinners
to come in. As for my own soul, God often gives me such foretastes of
His love, that I am almost continually wishing to be dissolved, that I
may be with Christ.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Had I a hundred hands, I could employ them all.
The harvest is very great. I am ashamed I can do no more for Him
who hath done so much for me. Every day affords fresh instances of
the power of His word. I am now about to attack Satan in one of his
strongholds, if I perish. To-night I preach, God willing, where a horse-race
is to be. I find my Master strengthens me for the work.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Methinks,
I could now sing my <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nunc Dimittis</i> with pleasure, if my eyes could see my
dear brother's salvation. I hope you have conversed with Mr. Wesley.
It will require some degree of boldness to own either of us before men.
God vouchsafes to honour us: no wonder our names are cast out as evil.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
I rejoice there is a revival of true religion in Scotland. The Spirit of God
is moving thousands of souls in England. God will work, and all oppositions
must forward, but not hinder it. I am no friend to sinless perfection.
I believe the being (though not the dominion) of sin remains in the
hearts of the greatest believers. At the call of Christ, I am now going
abroad, and expect to suffer many things before I return home."<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, that, in Whitefield's sermons, the
first time he prominently refers to his doctrine of election, is
in the sermon he preached at Stoke Newington, on July 31,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
from Genesis iii. 15.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> In the same sermon, he also alludes
to what, in the extract just given, he designates "sinless
perfection." These were the principal points on which he
and his friend Wesley afterwards differed. Perhaps it is
difficult to determine, with certainty, the cause of his adopting
these Calvinistic tenets; but it is a curious coincidence,
that he had recently entered into a hearty correspondence
with the Rev. Ralph Erskine, and that, within the last two
months, he had read Erskine's sermons.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> In the "Life of
Sir Richard Hill," it is stated that Whitefield was not a
Calvinist until he went to America, in 1739. It was there,
"he caught the tone and imbibed the opinions of the great,
the searching, but too gloomy Jonathan Edwards. His
'Treatise on the Will' was too deep a book for Whitefield,
and the probability is, that the author himself was somewhat
out of his own depth when he wrote it.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> No wonder
that when Whitefield first came into contact with Edwards,
he 'winced a little under his metaphysical probe;' but, at
last, he adopted his Calvinistic views, though it may be fairly
doubted if he ever fully understood them."<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> This is partly,
but not perfectly correct. There can be no doubt that, in
America, Whitefield "caught the tone and imbibed the
opinions of Edwards;" but Whitefield was inclined to
Calvinistic doctrines before he met with Edwards, and it is
almost certain that he "imbibed" these from the sermons of
his friends in Scotland, Ralph and Ebenezer Erskine. Whitefield's
Calvinism was suddenly born in England, about the
month of June, 1739; but it was cradled and greatly
strengthened in America, during the year 1740. From first
to last, it was a confused sort of thing. Even the Calvinistic
author of the "Life of Sir Richard Hill" justly acknowledges
that "it may be fairly doubted" whether Whitefield
ever fully understood the Calvinism which he preached.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
To the end of life, his theological erudition was comparatively
small. His forte was, not to discuss and defend "the five
points," but, with a full heart, to warn the wicked of their
sin and danger, and to lead and bring them to the all-sufficient
Saviour. His throne was the pulpit, not the professor's
chair. He missed his way when he became the
defender of the philosophical niceties of the Calvinian creed.
Like Jonathan Edwards, he "was somewhat out of his own
depth." I must be excused for saying, once for all, he was
led into error. I totally disbelieve his Calvinian doctrines.
But, having said as much as this, and whilst sorrowing that
his embracing those doctrines should have occasioned a
temporary breach of the friendship existing between him
and Wesley, it is an unquestionable fact that this opened to
Whitefield a wide field of usefulness, which, without it,
neither he nor Wesley could have occupied. Without this,
Whitefield could not have had the sympathy and co-operation
of the Presbyterians and Independents of America. It
was this that prepared the way for his popularity in Scotland.
But for this, he would have lacked the important
patronage of the Countess of Huntingdon. This was one of
the prime sources of the immense influence he exercised
over Hervey, Berridge, Romaine, Venn, and many other
contemporaneous clergymen of the Church of England;
and it also, to an untold extent, enabled him to move and
quicken the Dissenting ministers and congregations of the
land.</p>

<p>In the foregoing extracts from Whitefield's Journals, some
of the sermons he preached are specified. Most of these
were published; and a few brief selections from them will,
perhaps, best convey an idea of the peculiarities of Whitefield's
ministry at this important period of his life.</p>

<p>On July 31, at Stoke Newington, his text was Genesis
iii. 15, and the following are two extracts from the
sermon:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We must take care of healing before we see sinners wounded.
Sinners must hear the thunderings of Mount Sinai, before we bring them
to Mount Zion. They who never preach the law, it is to be feared, are
unskilful in delivering the glad tidings of the gospel. Every minister
should be a Boanerges, a son of thunder, as well as a Barnabas, a son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
consolation. There was an earthquake and a whirlwind before the still
small voice came to Elijah. We must first shew people they are condemned,
and then shew them how they must be saved."</p></blockquote>

<p>The next quotation is a good specimen of Whitefield's
fiery denunciation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Are there any enemies of God here? The promise of the text
encourages me to bid you defiance. What signifies all your malice? You
are only raging waves of the sea, foaming out your own shame. For you,
without repentance, is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever. The
Lord Jesus sits in heaven, ruling over all, and causing all things to work
for His children's good. He laughs you to scorn. He hath you in the
utmost derision, and therefore, so will I. Who are you that persecute
the children of the ever-blessed God? Though a poor stripling, the Lord
Jesus, the seed of the woman, will enable me to bruise your heads."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the sermon, at Blackheath, on August 7, respecting
the conversion of Zaccheus, the following passages occur:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I should think it no scandal to hear it affirmed, that none but the
poor attended my ministry. Their souls are as precious to our Lord
Jesus Christ as the souls of the greatest men. They were the poor that
attended Him in the days of His flesh; these are they whom He hath
chosen to be rich in faith, and to be the greatest in the kingdom of
heaven. Were the rich in this world's goods generally to speak well of
me, woe be unto me! I should think it a dreadful sign that I was only a
wolf in sheep's clothing; that I spoke peace, peace, when there was no
peace; and prophesied smoother things than the gospel would allow.
Hear ye this, O ye rich! Let who will dare to do it, God forbid that I
should despise the poor! In doing so, I should reproach my Maker.
The poor are dear to my soul."</p></blockquote>

<p>The next paragraph is an ample reply to the accusation
that Whitefield's preaching led to licentiousness:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What has been said of Zaccheus may serve as a rule whereby to
judge whether you have faith or not. You say you have faith; but how
do you prove it? Are you influenced by the faith, you say you have, to
stand up and confess the Lord Jesus before men? Were you ever made
willing to own, and humble yourselves for, your past offences? Does your
faith work by love, so that you conscientiously lay up, according as God
hath prospered you, for the support of the poor? Do you give alms of
all things that you possess? And have you made due restitution to those
you have wronged? If you are not thus minded, do not deceive yourselves.
Though you may talk of justification, like angels, it will do you no good;
it will only increase your damnation. You hold the truth, but it is
in unrighteousness. Your faith, being without works, is dead. You have
the devil, not Abraham, for your father. Unless you get a faith of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
heart, a faith working by love, with devils and damned spirits shall you
dwell for evermore."</p></blockquote>

<p>On August 8, at Blackheath, Whitefield preached on
the Pharisee and Publican. Three extracts must suffice.
The first contains Whitefield's views on the use of forms of
prayer, and praying extemporary. Speaking of the Pharisee,
he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He did not pray by form. His was an extempore prayer; for there are
many Pharisees who pray, and preach too, extempore. I do not see why
these may not be acquired, as well as other arts and sciences. A man
with a good elocution, ready turn of thought, and good memory, may
repeat his own and other men's sermons, and may pray seemingly excellently
well, and yet not have the least grain of true grace in his heart. I
speak this, not to cry down extempore prayer, or to discourage those who
really pray by the Spirit. I would only hereby give a word of reproof to
those who are so bigoted to extempore prayer, that they condemn all
who use forms, as though not so holy and heavenly, as others who pray
without them. Alas! this is wrong. Not every one that prays extempore
is a spiritual, nor every one that prays with a form, a formal man. Let
us not judge one another. Let not him who uses a form judge him who
prays extempore, on that account; and let not him who prays extempore
despise him who uses a form."</p></blockquote>

<p>The next quotation is on the prayer of the Publican, and
is a good example of the pith and point of Whitefield's
preaching:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Methinks, I see him standing afar off, pensive, oppressed, and even
overwhelmed with sorrow. He smites upon his breast, his treacherous,
ungrateful, desperately wicked breast&mdash;a breast now ready to burst; and
at length, out of the abundance of his heart, and with many tears, cries
out, 'God be merciful to me a sinner!' Not, God be merciful to yonder
proud Pharisee! Not, God be merciful to me a saint! for he knew 'all his
righteousnesses were as filthy rags.' Not, God be merciful to such or such
an one; God be merciful to me, even to me a sinner,&mdash;a sinner by birth,&mdash;a
sinner by thought, word, and deed,&mdash;a sinner as to my person,&mdash;a
sinner as to all my performances,&mdash;a sinner in whom is no health, in whom
dwelleth no good thing,&mdash;a sinner, poor, miserable, blind, and naked,&mdash;a
self-accused, self-condemned sinner. What think you? Would this
publican have been offended, if any minister had told him he deserved to
be damned? Would he have been angry, if any one had told him, that,
by nature, he was half a devil and half a beast? No; he would have
confessed a thousand hells to have been his due; and that he was an
earthly, devilish sinner."</p></blockquote>

<p>The next extract is one of Whitefield's terrible declamations;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Hear this, all ye self-justiciaries, tremble, and behold your doom! a
dreadful doom, more dreadful than words can express, or thoughts conceive!
If you refuse to humble yourselves, after hearing this parable, I
call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that God shall visit
you with all His storms, and pour all the vials of His wrath upon your
rebellious heads. You exalted yourselves here, and God shall abase you
hereafter. You are as proud as the devil, and with devils shall you dwell
to all eternity. Notwithstanding you come up to the temple to pray,
your prayers are turned into sin, and you go down to your houses unjustified.
And, if you are unjustified, the wrath of God abideth upon you.
You are in your blood. All the curses of the law belong to you. Cursed
are you when you go out; cursed are you when you come in; cursed are
your thoughts; cursed are your words; cursed are your deeds. Everything
you do, say, or think, from morning to night, is only one continued
series of sin. However highly you may be honoured in the Church
militant, you will have no place in the Church triumphant. 'Humble
yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God.' Pull down every
self-righteous thought, and every proud imagination, that now exalteth
itself against the perfect, personal, imputed righteousness of the dear Lord
Jesus. 'For he,' and he alone, 'that humbleth himself, shall be exalted.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>No wonder that fiery eloquence like this attracted notice;
and no wonder that it brought upon the preacher the fierce
censures of his enemies. The <cite>Weekly Miscellany</cite> was more
furious than ever. The following are specimens of its outpourings:&mdash;</p>

<p>On July 7, there was a long letter "to the Rev. Mr.
Seagrave," in which Whitefield and his friends were accused
of causing "all the miseries attending those poor, weak
wretches and their families, who, by the woes and curses
denounced on them in default of raising their imagination to
the pitch of enthusiasm, had been driven into a belief of
their certain damnation, and, consequently, into all the
horrors of despair and distraction."</p>

<p>On July 21, the leading article, filling nearly two folio
pages, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The novelist in religion passes with me either for a fool or a knave.
These things frequently begin in want of sense, but always end in want
of honesty. To keep attention and prevent satiety, false religion is continually
changing its dress, as in masquerades, varying its voice, and
accommodating its motions, according to all the mazes of error and
sportive turns of madness and folly. It gives the rein to every licentious
humour, or practises amazing austerities; it distorts the limbs, and screws
the features; it laughs, it sings, it weeps, it screams, it groans, it raves
in streets, bawls on commons, preaches from walls, and carts, and stools,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and windows; expounds, prays, exclaims. The enthusiast is now a
quietist, and does nothing; and, anon, in perpetual motion, and never at
rest. Sometimes, he is a meteor, which just flashes and disappears; and,
sometimes, a direful comet, seen for a long time, and carrying mischief
and destruction in the sweep of his tail."</p></blockquote>

<p>The article proceeds to stigmatise Whitefield as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Behold, on yonder eminence, the preacher, with admiring, subscribing
crowds about him. 'He is young.' Good! 'How innocent he looks.'
Better! 'He has no human learning.' Best of all! 'He knows everything
without labour, without study.' Prodigious! See! he spreads his
hands, and opens his lips as wide as possible. Hark! Hark! he talks
of a sensible new birth! Then, belike, he is in labour, and the good
women around him are come to his assistance. He dilates himself,&mdash;cries
out,&mdash;the hill swells into a mountain,&mdash;and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parturiunt montes,
nascetur ridiculus mus</i>. Well: he is, at last, delivered; he has felt the
new birth; and damns all that have not."</p></blockquote>

<p>The learned lampooner calls Whitefield "a modern prating
youth," "a visionary <em>Anticle</em>, in a gown and cassock;" and
proceeds to say:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is quite impossible to be serious with buffoons in religion, and
mountebanks in theology; to dispute with a creature, who disclaims sense,
and is below argument. He holds forth from the stairs of a wind-mill,
and never was exceeded, but by the Knight of de la Mancha flying on
the sails of it. He has formed a society of females, who are to confess
their love affairs one to another, and to take care there shall be a supply
of new Methodists for future generations. He has collected, without
letters, patents, license, or protection, larger sums than usually appear
upon any gaming table; and, yet, has incurred no penalty by it. If this
fund be employed for the purpose given out, the Orphan House is like to
exceed all the palaces in Europe. Supposing this humour to go on, I
know nothing the growling clergy have to do, but to leave sense and
honesty, their little pulpits and less incomes; and to bawl profitable
exclamations, with great enlargement, on commons, and get thousands by
it. In short, we must put a stop to this sharping trade of the Methodists;
or we must all, man, woman, and child, join in the plunder with them."</p></blockquote>

<p>On August 4, nearly an entire page was used in defending
Dr. Trapp, and abusing Whitefield. In reference to
Whitefield's exclamation, "O that my head were waters,"
etc., the writer sneeringly remarks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If his eyes were as full of tears as his heart could wish, what a glorious
man he would be to preach a funeral sermon! And if his head were an
ocean, he would certainly drown all his congregation, even though he were
to preach on Kennington Common."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>On August 11, the editor, Mr. Hooker, wrote nearly two
pages, in defence of Dr. Stebbing and Dr. Hammond, on the
new birth, and, of course, in denouncing Whitefield and his
friends:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Some Methodists," says he, "have made their <em>boasts</em> that they are
<em>become fools for Christ's sake</em>, in which there is something of truth that
they do not intend. But, if they think it commendable to be <em>fools</em> for
Christ, I hope they will never think it tolerable to be <em>knaves</em> for Him too."</p></blockquote>

<p>The <cite>Weekly Miscellany</cite> continued, almost without interruption,
these coarse attacks, to the end of 1739; but one
added extract must suffice. On December 29, nearly
two pages of the newspaper were filled with a violent
philippic against Whitefield as a Dissenter. The writer
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Whitefield has been attacked as an enthusiast, and often as a teacher
of false and pestilent doctrine; but not often as a Dissenter."</p></blockquote>

<p>Having adduced proofs that Whitefield was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i> a
Dissenter, the article proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He runs about the world, preaches, prays, exhorts, expounds, and
does what he lists, where he lists, and how he lists; sets at nought
his diocesan wherever he comes; and does all, not only independently,
but, in defiance of him. This is your <em>Church of England</em> minister! An
independent churchman! A perfect original! The first of the kind!
He has thrown off the liturgy of the Church of England, and gives the
people nothing but his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extempore</i> effusions in its stead. He not only
uses, but magnifies and extols, at a great rate, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extempore</i> prayer, to beget
in people a disesteem of all <em>forms</em>."</p></blockquote>

<p>The writer then adverts to Whitefield's patronising the
preaching of Howell Harris, the layman, and says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Dissenters are fond of him; but not a man among them has the
grace to go out into the highways and hedges, and compel poor sinners
to come in. None of them <em>ever would</em>, or <em>will now</em>, supply, in his
absence, his place, in Moorfields, or on Kennington Common. Not they.
They would never so much as sit, like some of ours, in their proper habits,
while he was preaching, some on his right hand and some on his left,
to do him honour before the people. But they would breakfast, dine, and
eat a little supper with him. They would partake of his entertainments,
or entertain him themselves in their own houses, and treat him most
courteously, not only to engage him to speak handsomely of them in his
journals, but to encourage him; to clap him on the back, and bid him go
on in the glorious work he had undertaken. But let them take care.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Proximus ardet.</i> Enthusiasm runs like wildfire, and, though it begins in
the Church of God Established, it may not stop there, but may run among, and
consume their own churches."</p></blockquote>

<p>Among the London newspapers, the <cite>Weekly Miscellany</cite>
was the most rabid of Whitefield's opponents; but, occasionally,
others of them had slashing articles against the
young evangelist. For instance, the <em>Craftsman</em>, of September
8, in a serio-comic article, propounds "A Scheme of a
new Court of Judicature, in which Methodists are to preside."
The members of the court were to be four-and-twenty in
number, "with an archon at the head of them: the first
archon to be the most excellent and industrious Mr. Whitefield,
or, in his absence, the ingenious Mr. Wesley; and the
four-and-twenty to be chosen from among the Methodists
on Kennington Common." They were to be provided with
food and clothing; the clothing of each member was to cost
£2 6s. 8<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub>d. per year; the diet 2<sup><small>3</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub>d. per day; and the stipend
was to be £2 a year, which would "be sufficient to buy
them books of devotion."</p>

<p>Besides attacks like these in the public papers, Whitefield
was severely censured in private conversation and correspondence.
The Rev. William Law was a man of distinguished
piety and talent; and his writings had been of eminent
service to Whitefield and his friends. Again and again, they
sought his counsel; and, speaking generally, he had always
shewn them kindness. But even Mr. Law now turned
against the young evangelist. On August 10, Charles
Wesley waited upon him, and wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He blamed Mr. Whitefield's journals, and way of proceeding; said he
had had great hopes that the Methodists would have been dispersed, by
little and little, into livings, and have leavened the whole lump. Among
other things, he said, 'Were I so talked of as Mr. Whitefield is, I should
run away, and hide myself entirely.' 'You might,' I answered, 'but God
would bring you back like Jonah.'"<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Warburton, an attorney's son, born at Newark-upon-Trent,
was now rising into fame. He had recently published
the first volume of his great work on "The Divine Legation
of Moses," and, twenty years afterwards, was made bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
of Gloucester. In two letters, to the Rev. Mr. Birch, one
dated "September 16, 1738," and the other, "September
10, 1739," Warburton says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have seen Whitefield's Journal, and read it with great curiosity. The
poor man is quite mad. His honesty, as you say, is very conspicuous.
The best way of exposing these idle fanatics would be to print passages
out of George Fox's Journal, and Ignatius Loyola, and Whitefield's
Journals, in parallel columns.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Their conformity in folly is amazing. One
thing was extremely singular in Loyola: he became, from the modestest
fanatic that ever was, the most cold-hearted knave, by the time his Society
was thoroughly established. The same natural temperament, that set
his brains on a heat, worked off the ferment. The case was so uncommon
that his adversaries thought all his fanaticism pretended. But, in this,
they were certainly mistaken. The surprising part of all was, that his
folly and knavery concurred so perfectly to promote his end. If I be not
mistaken in Whitefield, he bids fair for acting the second part of Loyola,
as he has done the first."<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Another private letter, by a very different personage, will
be read with interest. The celebrated Countess of Hertford,
afterwards Duchess of Somerset, writing to the Countess of
Pomfret, then on the continent, remarks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I do not know whether you have heard of our new sect, who call
themselves Methodists. There is one Whitefield at the head of them, a
young man under five-and-twenty, who has, for some months, gone about
preaching in the fields and market-places of the country; and in London,
at Mayfair and Moorfields, to ten or twelve thousand people at a time.
He went to Georgia, and returned to take priest's orders, which he did;
and, I believe, since that time, hardly a day has passed that he has not
preached, and generally twice. At first, he and some of his brethren
seemed only to aim at restoring the practice of the primitive Christians,
as to daily sacraments, stated fasts, frequent prayers, relieving prisoners,
visiting the sick, and giving alms to the poor; but, upon sound ministers
refusing these men their pulpits, they have betaken themselves to preaching
in the fields; and they have such crowds of followers, that they have
set in a flame all the clergy of the kingdom, who represent them as
hypocrites and enthusiasts. As to the latter epithet, some passages in
Mr. Whitefield's latest journals seem to countenance the accusation; but,
I think, their manner of living has not afforded any grounds to suspect
them of hypocrisy. The Bishop of London, however, has thought it
necessary to write a pastoral letter, to warn the people of his diocese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
against being led away by them; though, at the same time, he treats
them personally with great tenderness and moderation. I cannot say,
Dr. Trapp has done the same, in a sermon which he has published,
entitled, 'The Great Folly and Danger of being Righteous over-much,' a
doctrine which does not seem absolutely necessary to be preached to the
people of the present age."<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This long list of publications, all issued in the year 1739,
is abundant proof of the commotion created by young
Whitefield and the Methodists. A few, but only a few, were
written in defence of Whitefield. The last mentioned was
one. In the same category must be placed the two pamphlets
by Mr. Seagrave, one of which has been already noticed.
No. 47 in the list is also favourable to Whitefield, and is a
well-written production. No. 21 is an extravagant eulogium
on Whitefield, and a violent attack on the clergy of the
Established Church. "Whitefield," says the writer, "has set
them an example, which they must, in some measure, follow.
But for him, they could have gone on in their old way as
well as ever; and their corn, and their wine, and their pigs,
and their eggs, and their apples would have come in as usual.
All besides is unnecessary trouble; and they detest the
man who has put them upon it." No. 27 also is favourable,
but contains little that is worth noticing. "Dr. Trapp Tried
and Cast," by Jonathan Warne, tells the Doctor that "there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
is more profound divinity in one of Whitefield's sermons,
than in the whole of his four discourses." "The Letter to
the Bishop of London," by Philalethes, was also a mild, but
not remarkable, defence of Whitefield. No. 43 is a rather
elaborate apology for some of Whitefield's unguarded sayings,
and is ably written. "The Dreadful Degeneracy of a great
part of the Clergy," by Jonathan Warne, is a long production
of more than a hundred octavo pages. It is, however, more
a defence of the doctrines Whitefield preached, than of
Whitefield himself.</p>

<p>Out of the forty-nine publications, whose titles have been
given, not more than about ten can be regarded as at all
favourable to the young preacher. The rest were antagonistic,
and, in many instances, extremely virulent. In illustration
of this, a few extracts, almost promiscuously selected,
must suffice.</p>

<p>Tristram Land, after declaring that Whitefield "cannot be
exceeded by the warmest-headed Quaker in the kingdom,"
proceeds to say: "It is commonly reported you seldom
converse with the clergy of the Church of England, though
you are pleased to visit Dissenting teachers, and often mix
with the younger part of the laity of all denominations."
Mr. Land further accuses Whitefield of "rudeness to the
whole body of" the Clergy; of "bringing contempt upon the
Liturgy;" of "creating misunderstandings between the
parochial clergy and their people;" of "raising causeless
doubts and scruples in the minds of some well-disposed
Christians;" and of "encouraging the practice of <em>conventicling</em>
in several parts of London."</p>

<p>Dr. Stebbing, in his Sermon on the New Birth, sneeringly
observes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Whitefield, who had his orders among us, and still professes
himself a member of the Church of England, tells us of some conversations
he had with Quakers, in his journeyings. It seems they could not agree
about the use of the sacraments and the payment of tithes; but, says
he, 'I think their notions about walking and being led by the Spirit are
right and good.' The young man, you perceive, is in a very hopeful
way! He is a Quaker already in the first and leading principle of that
sect; and, as to his scruples about tithes, etc., they may <em>abate</em> as he
grows better acquainted with his associates."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>In "the Life of Whitefield, by an Impartial Hand," the
young preacher is accused, by the Rev. J. Tucker, of "propagating
blasphemous and enthusiastical notions." Mr. Tucker
dolorously adds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Some of Mr. Whitefield's followers have insulted and reviled me in
passing along the streets; and declared that they looked upon me as the
enemy of God and His religion. This was owing to Mr. Whitefield's
pointing at me so often in his prayers, and describing me in his harangues
to the populace." Mr. Tucker further relates, that, "to gain credit with
the populace, Whitefield often had in his mouth at Bristol this dreadful
imprecation, 'If what I say be not strictly true, may all that ever heard
me, may you that now hear me, and all that shall hear me hereafter, rise
up in judgment against me, and rejoice at my <em>damnation</em>!'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Wilder, in his Sermon "preached before the University
of Oxford, August 5, 1739," abounds in abusive epithets,
which need not be quoted; but two or three extracts will
be useful as displaying the fiery, fuming spirit of this university
preacher; and the animosity with which Whitefield was
regarded.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I cannot dismiss this point, without taking notice of the indecent, false,
unchristian reflections cast on the clergy of our Church, charging them
with popery and perjury, than which nothing is more unjust, except
the cruel mercies of those, who pass sentence of damnation upon all
who have not the same spiritual pride, vanity, and enthusiasm as themselves."</p>

<p>"He" (Whitefield) "is but a young son of the prophets, yet, if we will
take his word for it, he is as much inspired, and felt the Holy Ghost at
imposition of hands, as much as Elisha did, when Elijah dropped his
mantle. Nay, he has the modesty to compare himself, in his labours and
afflictions, with the great apostle of the Gentiles, and even with the Son of
God Himself."</p>

<p>"Let us hear what this inspired man saith of the new birth. We find,
from his writings, that the new birth is a conversion and change wrought
in the mind of a man, by a sensible operation of the Spirit of God; and
that those who have not experienced some such sensible change, in their
hearts, are not born again, nor in a state of salvation. If this be true, how
few of all the millions of the professors of Christianity are there, that have
been, or will be saved! Scarce any but the itinerant preacher, a few of
his followers, and some Quakers. If this doctrine be true, how is the
God of all mercy and goodness, the God of love, comfort, and joy, turned
into a cruel and tyrannical being, that delights not to save, but to destroy
mankind!"</p>

<p>"That they" (the Methodists) "teach doctrines inconsistent with, and
destructive of Christianity, appears from their encouraging religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
exercises, to the neglect of other Christian duties. How many, while
they run gaping after the spiritual food which these rambling teachers
pretend to distribute to them from heaven, leave their business at random,
and their families to want the necessary food of this life; not considering
that it is their duty to attend, at the appointed seasons, on the services and
ordinances of God, under their proper pastors, not in highways, in fields,
or commons, but in those places which are set apart for, and dedicated to,
God's honour and worship."</p>

<p>"His" (Whitefield's) "boasting of the Lord's assisting him to lift up his
voice like a trumpet, makes me believe, that, rather than return to a sober
mind, and leave the field, to preach sound doctrine in our churches, he is
resolved to make his voice the trumpet of war; and reduce, if possible,
this Church and State to anarchy and confusion: as it was effected once
in the last century, when by a successful rebellion begun, fomented, and
carried on, by the like spiritual enthusiasts, the life of the best of kings
was barbarously taken away; the best of monarchies changed into a
democracy; and this truly apostolical Church wounded, mangled, and,
by papists and puritans, crucified, like our Saviour, between two thieves."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such are fair specimens of the sermon which Mr. Wilder<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
"preached before the University of Oxford." Young Whitefield
was far from perfect; and, certainly, the same may
be said respecting his rebukers.</p>

<p>The Rev. Charles Wheatley, in St. Paul's Cathedral,
London, was less violent in his language than Mr. Wilder;
but, in foot-notes, gives unguarded extracts from Whitefield's
Journals, and exclaims, "Was there ever such a medley of
vanity, and nonsense, and blasphemy jumbled together?" In
his sermon, also, he speaks of the Methodists, as "assuming
to themselves, upon all occasions, the peculiar language of
the Holy Ghost; equalling themselves, in everything they
do, to prophets and apostles; and boasting of immediate
inspirations and extraordinary communications with God;
and, in proof of it, laying a blasphemous claim to greater
miracles than ever were performed by our blessed Saviour
Himself." Mr. Wheatley's sermon and foot-notes were almost
altogether levelled against Whitefield.</p>

<p>In another pamphlet (No. 28), "A Curate in the Country"
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I believe Mr. Whitefield set out with a zeal for God, though a mistaken
one. The pulpits were <em>then</em> open to him, in confidence that he would
preach nothing contrary to the Gospel; but when his mistakes were more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
known, and when his errors were so notorious that even <em>charity</em> could not
but see them; and when, to propagate these errors, he claimed the chair,
visiting every church, and violently taking possession of their pulpits, it
was the duty of the clergy to check the spreading evil, and refuse him the
liberty of misleading their people in their own churches. This he calls
being turned out of our synagogues, and complains of it as a hardship.
Who made him universal pastor? Who committed to him the care of <em>all</em>
the churches? Do such complaints become a meek disciple of Christ?
Is such behaviour the mark of a dutiful and true son of the Church of
England? What ill consequences may we not dread from so <em>bold</em> an
invader, from so <em>unreasonable</em> a separatist?"</p></blockquote>

<p>"A Curate in London" (in Pamphlet No. 33) writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Let us not be carried away by pretences&mdash;'tis hard to say to what.
Pretences! of weak and heated men, such as have, in all the different ages
of the Church, built up a faith of their own, always to the prejudice,
frequently to the ruin, of that once delivered to the saints."</p></blockquote>

<p>In "Methodism Displayed," by the Rev. James Bate,
M.A., Rector of St. Paul's, Deptford, there is an almost
unceasing reiteration of charges of pride, pertness, and impudence.</p>

<p>The "Compleat Account of that eminent Enthusiast, Mr.
Whitefield" (No. 36) tells its readers, that this "extraordinary
itinerant had lately made a progress into the
western parts of England, and some parts of Wales, where,
from <em>tombstones</em>, and <em>market-crosses</em>, on <em>commons</em> and <em>mountains</em>,
he had preached to vast numbers of ignorant people, and,
since his return to London, in a wide place near a building"
(Bedlam) "which would suit him much better." "He had
succeeded the <em>mountebank</em> in Moorfields, pretty near the
place where the <em>White Bear</em> exhibits himself to public view
every day (but <em>Sundays).</em> From the <em>wall</em>, instead of a <em>stage</em>,
he harangued his congregation, and, by the choice of his
text, most blasphemously compared himself, after his usual
custom, to our blessed Saviour."</p>

<p>From Pamphlet No. 46 the following is taken:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Whitefield behaved at first in part like a clergyman, but never
altogether so. Then he was looked upon as an impudent bold man; but
since as a wicked man. When, though an ecclesiastic, he opposed all
ecclesiastical maxims, and ran counter to all authority of the Church, he
was deemed a novelist; but when he daringly pleaded the impulse of the
Holy Spirit for these irregular proceedings, he was then, with equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
justice, deemed an enthusiast. Whether he is an impostor, God only
knows."</p></blockquote>

<p>After asserting that Whitefield has "sunk the house of
God below a play-house, and turned religion into a farce,"
the writer adds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I think it beyond all contradiction that he is in practice a Dissenter.
He has long thought fit to renounce the Liturgy of the Church of England,
and to pray extempore in his own words. The more we consider his
words and works, the more will he appear an enthusiast, a blasphemer,
and a wavering, wandering preacher of no establishment. He at first
touched upon the Church, but transgressed its order, so as not to continue
in it. At present, he seems near attached to the Dissenting communion,
though he does not omit to blend his notions with a good spice both of the
Roman Catholic and the Mahometan."</p></blockquote>

<p>All this wrathful outpouring was bad enough; but <em>one</em>
of the <em>most ribald</em> publications against Whitefield was (No.
41) "The Methodists: an Humorous Burlesque Poem,
addressed to the Rev. Mr. Whitefield and his Followers."
Some parts of this foul production cannot be quoted with
decency. Two extracts, both relating to Whitefield, must
suffice. After describing the devil's journey from Rome to
Oxford, the scurrilous poetaster writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The following are the last lines of this disgraceful production:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>More than enough of this. Only one other of the attacks
on Whitefield can be noticed. This, however, was the most
authoritative and serious. Edmund Gibson, D.D., was a
man of great ability and learning, a laborious student, and
one whose piety, it is said, was equal to his erudition. He
had now reached the age of three-score years and ten, was
Bishop of London, and Whitefield's diocesan. It is no mean
proof of the enormous excitement created by young Whitefield
and his friends, that this venerable and distinguished
man deemed it his duty to enter the lists against them.
He had already published three Pastoral Letters, "in defence
of the Gospel-revelation, and by way of preservative against
the late writings in favour of Infidelity." He now, on
August 1, issued a fourth, with the title, "The Bishop of
London's Pastoral Letter to the People of his Diocese;
especially those of the two great Cities of London and
Westminster; by way of Caution, against Lukewarmness on
one hand, and Enthusiasm on the other." (8vo. 55 pp.)
Before the year was ended, this letter passed, at least, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
three editions. Nineteen pages were devoted to "lukewarmness;"
the remainder to "enthusiasm." The charges brought
against the Methodists are nine in number; and it is a
remarkable fact, that all of them are supported, exclusively,
by quotations from Whitefield's loosely worded Journals.
The charges against Whitefield and his friends are these:&mdash;1.
A claim to <em>extraordinary communications</em> with God, and
more than ordinary assurances of a <em>special presence</em> with them.
2. Talking in the language of those who have a special and
immediate <em>mission</em> from God. 3. Professing to think and
act under the immediate guidance of a <em>Divine inspiration</em>.
4. Speaking of their preaching and expounding, and the
effects of them, as the sole work of a <em>Divine power</em>. 5. Boasting
of sudden and surprising effects as wrought by the <em>Holy
Ghost</em>, in consequence of their preaching. 6. Claiming the
spirit of <em>prophecy</em>. 7. Speaking of themselves in the language,
and under the character, of <em>apostles</em> of Christ, and even of
<em>Christ</em> Himself. 8. Professing to plant and propagate a <em>new
Gospel</em>, as unknown to the generality of ministers and people,
in a Christian country. 9. Endeavouring to justify their own
<em>extraordinary</em> methods of teaching, by casting unworthy
reflections upon the parochial clergy, as deficient in the
discharge of their duty, and not instructing their people in
the true doctrines of Christianity.</p>

<p>In support of these accusations, not fewer than ninety
quotations are made from Whitefield's Journals; but,
excepting one in proof of the last-mentioned allegation,
there are none which are not capable of an interpretation
widely different from that supplied by Bishop Gibson. No
doubt, many are unfortunately expressed.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> In not a few,
there is a semblance of ostentation, and even of religious pride,
which all educated and sober-minded Christians will condemn.
But, while honestly admitting such facts as these, it is preposterous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
to affirm that either Whitefield or the Wesleys
ever made pretensions like those ascribed to them by the
conscientious bishop of the London diocese. He thought
they did; but he was prejudiced and mistaken.</p>

<p>Whitefield was impulsive, and pre-eminently a man of
action. The Bishop's Pastoral Letter is dated, "August 1,
1739." On August 11, Whitefield began his answer to the
bishop's pamphlet; and, two days afterwards, sent it to the
press. It was composed at Blendon, and is one of the
smartest productions of his pen; its style firm, but quiet
and respectful; its language pure, pointed, forcible, and
without the diffusiveness which often characterised Whitefield's
writings. He had no assistance from the Wesleys, for John
was in the west of England, and Charles in London. The
celerity with which it was written deserves notice; for, during
the two days and a half devoted to it, Whitefield preached four
sermons, read prayers once, and, in Bexley church, assisted
in administering the sacrament to nearly six hundred persons.
The title was, "The Rev. Mr. Whitefield's Answer to the
Bishop of London's last Pastoral Letter." (8vo. 28 pp.) Want
of space precludes the insertion here of copious extracts.
It is enough to say, 1. That, Whitefield distinctly and
truthfully affirms, "I never did pretend to the <em>extraordinary</em>
operations of the Holy Spirit. I only lay claim to His
ordinary gifts and influences." 2. That, so far from setting
aside the teaching of the Established Church, he says, "My
constant way of preaching is, first, to prove my propositions
by Scripture, and then to illustrate them by the Articles
and Collects of the Church of England. Those who have
heard me can witness how often I have exhorted them to be
constant at the public service of the Church; I attend on it
myself; and would read the public Liturgy every day, if
your lordship's clergy would give me leave."</p>

<p>It is only fair to add, that, Whitefield honestly meets all
the charges brought against him; and that, upon the whole,
his "Answer" is complete and victorious.</p>

<p>This was Whitefield's only reply to the scores of antagonistic
pamphlets published during the year 1739. In the
same year, however, he issued a considerable number of other
publications, of which the following is a list:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. "A Journal of a Voyage from London to Savannah in Georgia. In
two parts. Part I. From London to Gibraltar. Part II. From Gibraltar
to Savannah. With a short Preface, shewing the reason of its publication."
8vo. 55 pp.</p>

<p>2. "A Continuation of the Rev. Mr. Whitefield's Journal, from his
Arrival at Savannah to his return to London." 8vo. 38 pp.</p>

<p>3. "A Continuation of the Rev. Mr. Whitefield's Journal, from his

Whitefield, for the Poor of Georgia." 8vo. 23 pp.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>These five publications have been so freely used in the
foregoing pages as to render further description unnecessary.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1739, appeared, 1. "Sermons on
Various Subjects. In two Volumes." (12mo. 161 and 150
pp.) And, 2. "The Christian's Companion; or, Sermons
on Several Subjects." (12mo. 335 pp.) The sermons, however,
contained in these volumes were partly sermons already
published in the years 1737 and 1738; and partly sermons
found in the following list,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> and published separately.</p>

<p>The whole of these twenty-seven publications were "printed
for C. Whitefield, London."</p>

<p>From an account book, in which Whitefield entered the
times and places of his ministerial labours, it appears that,
during his remarkable career, he preached upwards of eighteen
thousand sermons.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Of these, only eighty-one have been
printed; and even this number includes eighteen preached
during the last seven years of Whitefield's life, and which
can hardly be regarded as authentic, inasmuch as they were
taken in shorthand as delivered from the pulpit, and were
printed without Whitefield's revision, consent, or knowledge.
This reduces the number of his <em>authentic</em> discourses to sixty-three.
By these, the public have been accustomed to form
their opinions of Whitefield as a theologian and a preacher;
and, because the sermons are, in many respects, exceedingly
defective, the judgments pronounced respecting Whitefield's
intellectual culture, biblical learning, and literary skill, have
not been favourable. This is an unintended injustice to his
character and fame. How stands the case?</p>

<p>During his lifetime, Whitefield prepared about sixty-three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
of his sermons for the public press. Of these, twenty have
been already noticed in the foregoing pages. Add to these
the twenty-six sermons, included in the list just given, and
all preached during the year 1739, and it will be found,
that, of the sixty-three authentic sermons, printed in Whitefield's
collected works, at least forty-six were preached, and
committed to the press, before he was twenty-five years of
age. Is it fair that Whitefield's sermonising abilities should
be determined by these juvenile productions?</p>

<p>Want of space renders it impossible to enlarge upon the
remaining twenty-six sermons not already noticed; and yet,
as the year, in which these sermons were delivered, was, in
many respects, the most important period of Whitefield's
life, a few extracts, even at the expense of wearying the
reader, must be given.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Spiritual Pride.</em>&mdash;"To check all suggestions to spiritual pride, let us
consider that we did not apprehend Christ, but were apprehended of Him;
that we have nothing but what we have received; that the free grace of
God has alone made the difference between us and others; that were God
to leave us to the deceitfulness of our own hearts, but one moment, we
should become weak and wicked like other men; that being proud of
grace is the most ready way to lose it; and that were we endowed with
the perfections of seraphims, if we were proud of those perfections, they
would but render us more accomplished devils." (Sermon on Satan's
Devices.)</p>

<p><em>Catholic Spirit.</em>&mdash;"When we confine the Spirit of God to this or that
particular church, and are not willing to converse with any but those of
the same communion, this is to be righteous over-much with a witness;
and so it is to confine our communion within church walls, and to think
that Jesus could not be in a field, as well as on consecrated ground. This
is Judaism; this is bigotry; this is like Peter, who would not go to preach
the gospel to the Gentiles, till he had a vision sent from God. The Spirit
of God is the centre of unity; and wherever I see the image of my Master,
I never enquire of them their opinions: I ask them not what they are, so
they love Jesus Christ in sincerity and truth; but embrace them as my
brother, my sister, and my spouse. This is the spirit of Christianity.
Many persons who are bigots to this or that opinion, when one of a
different way of thinking has come where they were, have left the room or
place on that account. This is the spirit of the devil; and, if it were
possible that these persons could be admitted into heaven with these
tempers, that very place would be a hell to them. Christianity will never
flourish till we are all of one heart and of one mind. This may be esteemed
as enthusiasm and madness, and as a design to undermine the Established
Church: no, God is my judge, I should rejoice to see all the world adhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
to her Articles. I am a friend to her Articles. I am a friend to her
Homilies. I am a friend to her Liturgy; and, if they did not thrust me
out of their churches, I would read them every day; but I do not confine
the Spirit of God there, for, I say it again, I love all that love the Lord
Jesus Christ." (Sermon on the Folly and Danger of not being Righteous
enough.)</p>

<p><em>Innocent Diversions.</em>&mdash;"They talk of innocent diversions and recreations.
For my part, I know of no diversion but that of doing good. If
you can find any diversion which is not contrary to your baptismal vow,
of renouncing the pomps and vanities of this wicked world; if you can
find any diversion which tends to the glory of God; if you can find
any diversion which you would be willing to be found at by the Lord
Jesus Christ, I give you my free license to go to them. But if, on the
contrary, they are found to keep sinners from coming to the Lord Jesus
Christ; if they are a means to harden the heart, and such as you would
not willingly be found in when you come to die, then, my dear brethren,
keep from them. Many of you may think I have gone too far, but I shall
go a great deal farther yet. I will attack the devil in his strongest holds,
and bear my testimony against our fashionable and polite entertainments.
What pleasure is there in spending several hours at cards? Is it not
misspending your precious time, which should be spent in working out
your salvation with fear and trembling? Do play-houses, horse-racing,
balls, and assemblies tend to promote the glory of God? Would you be
willing to have your souls demanded of you while you are at one of those
places? What good can come from a horse-race, from abusing God
Almighty's creatures, and putting them to a use He never designed them?
The play-houses are nurseries of debauchery, and the supporters of them
are encouragers and promoters of all the evil that is done there. They
are the bane of the age, and will be the destruction of the frequenters of
them. Is it not high time for the true ministers of Jesus Christ to lift up
their voices as a trumpet, and cry aloud against the diversions of the age?
If you have tasted of the love of God, and have felt His power upon your
souls, you would no more go to a play than you would run your heads
into a furnace. And what occasions these places to be so much frequented
is the clergy's making no scruple to be at these polite entertainments themselves.
They frequent play-houses; they go to horse-races; they go to
balls and assemblies; they frequent taverns, and follow all the entertainments
that the age affords; and, yet, these are the persons who should
advise their hearers to refrain from them. They always go disguised, for
they are afraid of being seen in their gowns and cassocks; for their consciences
inform them that it is not an example fit for the ministers of the
gospel to set." (Ibid.)</p>

<p>"Those, my brethren, are not weary and heavy-laden with a sense of
their sins, who can delight themselves in the polite entertainments of the
age. Now they can go to balls and assemblies, play-houses and horse-racing.
They have no thought of their sins. They know not what it is
to weep for sin, or humble themselves under the mighty hand of God.
They can laugh away their sorrows, and sing away their cares. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
too polite to entertain any sad thoughts, and the talk of death and judgment
is irksome to them, because it damps their mirth. They could not
go to a play, and think of hell. They could not go quietly to a masquerade,
and think of their danger. They could not go to a ball, if they thought
of their sins. But, at the day of judgment, all will be over. All their
carnal mirth, all their pleasure, all their delight, will be gone for ever.
They think now that if they were to fast, or to pray, and meditate and
mourn, they would be righteous over-much. Their lives would be a continual
trouble, and it would make them mad. Alas! my brethren, what
misery must that life be, where there are no more pleasant days, no more
balls, or plays, no cards, or dice, no horse-racing, and cock-fighting! How
miserable will your life be when all your joys are over, when your pleasures
are all past, no more mirth, or pastime! Do you think, my brethren,
there is one merry heart in hell? one pleasing countenance? or jesting,
scoffing, swearing tongue? A sermon now is irksome. The offer of
salvation, by the blood of Jesus Christ, is now termed enthusiasm; but
there you would give a thousand worlds for one offer of mercy, which now
you so much despise. Now you are not weary of your diversions, nor
heavy-laden with the sins with which they are accompanied; but then you
will be weary of your punishments. Your cards and dice, your hawks and
hounds, your bowls and pleasant sports, will then be over! What mirth
will you have in remembering them!" (Sermon on Christ the only Rest
for the Weary and Heavy-laden.)</p>

<p>"What good can proceed from play-houses, where God is profaned, the
devil honoured, your time misspent, your souls endangered? Dare any
of you who profess Christianity, frequent these places? Would you be
willing to be found at a play, or reading one, when God demands your
souls? If so, why do not you, when upon a sick or dying bed, instead of
sending for a minister to pray with you, send for a comedian to comfort
you through the dark valley of the shadow of death? But though these
things are so destructive, our learned Rabbins do not warn the people of
their danger. No; they are too great frequenters of them themselves. If
you come to hear a sermon, your families are ruined, they are neglected.
This is the cry of the Pharisees of this generation; but if you spend six
times the time at a play-house, at a ball, at an assembly, at cards, dice, or
any of their polite entertainments, nothing is said then against ruining
your families, or losing your business. But, my brethren, ask yourselves
which will be best, at a dying hour, to think you spent so much time at a
play, a ball, or a neighbouring place of vanity;<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> or of hearing the word of
God from a poor despised field-preacher? from a mountebank? from a
babbler, as the world is pleased to term me? You may call this enthusiasm,
if you like; but I speak the truth, I lie not; these diversions, these
innocent, polite, fashionable entertainments of the age, are only hurrying
the infidels, who attend them, faster to hell. What is the common language
of these polite entertainments, but the language of hell? What are their frequent
prayers, but for damnation? Will these polite and fashionable entertainments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
bring you to Jesus Christ? Will they make you sensible of the
need you have of Him? Can you see the necessity of being born again,
by following horse-racing, and by seeing a poor abused creature carrying
its rider faster into hell? But what makes these places to be the more
frequented, is, the clergy make no scruple about being there themselves.
They neglect the work of their calling. Their sermons are but a week's
study to please the ears of the people, or to advance their own reputation.
If they were here, I, a boy, would tell them to their face that they do not
preach the doctrines of the Reformation; that they feed not their hearers
with food convenient for them. No: Seneca, Cicero, Plato, or any of the
heathen philosophers would preach as good doctrine as we hear in most
of our churches. Our ministers subscribe to their Articles, and think no
more about them. They use them as a key to get preferment; and, when
they have got it, they put the key into their pockets. Many, very many
of our clergy, know no more of regeneration than Nicodemus did, when
he came to Christ by night. To talk of feeling the Spirit of God, is esteemed
as nonsense; and persons have been forbidden the sacrament
only for reading my books; but, as my books and sermons are agreeable
to the doctrines of Jesus Christ, I dare venture my salvation on the truth
of them." (Sermon on the Polite and Fashionable Diversions of the Age.)<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>"The clergy charge us with being over-righteous; but let them take
care lest they are not over-remiss. Let them examine their own lives
before they condemn others for enthusiasts. It is manifest that their
actions are unbecoming of Christians, and more especially of ministers of
the Church of England. They make no scruple of frequenting taverns
and public-houses. They make no conscience of playing several hours
at billiards, bowls, and other unlawful games, which they esteem as innocent
diversions. Plurality of livings, and not the salvation of your souls,
is the aim, the chief aim, of many, very many, of our present clergy.
They have quite forsaken the good old way, and brought up a new one
which their fathers knew not. They don't catechise. They don't visit
from house to house. They don't watch over their flocks, by examining
their lives. They keep up no constant religious conversation in families
under their care. No, my brethren, these things are neglected; and if
they were to be acted by any one, the person would be esteemed as an
enthusiast, and as righteous over-much. We may justly cry to my letter-learned
brethren, 'Physicians, heal yourselves.' Don't flatter yourselves
that a long gown, and great preferment, authorise you to speak, write, or
preach against the doctrines of our Lord Jesus Christ. No, my letter-learned,
pleasure-seeking brethren, Jesus Christ, at the day of judgment,
will judge you, not as doctors and rulers, but by the deeds done in the
body, whether they be good, or whether they be evil. At the great day,
we shall all be upon a level. No distinction there! No difference there!
If they had preached Jesus Christ in sincerity and truth, I would not
have opened my mouth against them; but when they exclaim, 'The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
temple of the Lord! the temple of the Lord!' and are building up the
temple of the devil, if I were not to preach, the very stones would cry out.
They may thrust me out of their churches, but they cannot thrust me from
the Church of Christ. They are welcome to say what they please of me.
They may cast me out, and say all manner of evil against me; yea, they
may put me to death; but as my day is, so my strength shall be. I have
a gracious Master, and into His hands I commit myself, and leave all my
affairs to His wise discretion." (Sermon on Jesus Christ the only Way of
Salvation.)<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It would be easy to multiply extracts like these; but, to
exhibit more fully the character of Whitefield's preaching, a
few of another kind must be introduced.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Self-Righteousness.</em>&mdash;"How many are there who go to church, and say
their prayers, and receive the sacrament, and give alms to the poor, and
then think themselves good Christians, because they have done so; and
when we tell them that all this will not do, they immediately cry out, we
are preaching them to despair. But, O good God! Thou knowest that I
wish I could bring all men off from this undoing delusion, that will but
betray them into everlasting misery. It is because I know such persons
are more odious, in the sight of God, than the vilest sinners, that makes
me so earnest in warning them of their guilt and danger; for I have more
hope of common swearers, drunkards, fornicators, Sabbath-breakers, and
harlots, and of deists and infidels, than I have of such self-righteous
Pharisees. It is against these that almost all our Saviour's parables are
levelled. If you depend upon your own duties, you are but Pharisees and
hypocrites, for hypocrites may do all this as the Pharisees did. There is
no doubt that you are to do your duty; but, if you depend upon your
duties, you make a Saviour of them, and deny the righteousness of our
Lord Jesus Christ. You may go in an easy, decent, and polite way of
religion, and obtain a reputation in the sight of men; but you are odious
in the sight of God, and incarnate devils within." (Sermon on the
Necessity of the Righteousness of Christ.)<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>"O ye Pharisees, what fruits do ye bring forth? Why, you are moral,
polite creatures. You do your endeavours, and Jesus is to make up the
rest. You esteem yourselves fine, rational, and polite beings, and think
it is too unfashionable to pray. It is not polite enough. Perhaps you
have read some prayers, but knew not how to pray from your hearts. No,
by no means! That was being righteous over-much! But if once, my
brethren, you were sensible of your being lost, damned creatures, and
see hell gaping ready to receive you, then, O then, you would cry earnestly
unto the Lord to receive you, to open the door of mercy unto you. Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
tones would then be changed. You would no more flatter yourselves with
your abilities and good wishes. No: you would see how unable you were
to save yourselves; that there is no fitness, no free-will in you: no fitness
but for eternal damnation; and no free-will but that of doing evil. Ye
Pharisees, who are going about to establish your own righteousness; who
are too polite to follow the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity and truth; who
are all for a little show, a little outside work; who lead moral, civil, decent
lives, Christ will not know you at the great day, but will say unto you,
'Depart from me, ye workers of iniquity, unto that place of torment, prepared
for the devil and his angels.' Good God! and must these discreet,
polite creatures, who never did any one harm, but led such civil, decent
lives, must they suffer the vengeance of eternal fire? Cannot their
righteous souls be saved? Where then must the sinner and the ungodly
appear?" (Sermon on Christ the only Rest for the Weary.)</p>

<p><em>Warnings.</em>&mdash;"O the folly and madness of this sensual world! O consider
this, you who think it no crime to swear, whore, drink, or scoff and
jeer at the people of God,&mdash;consider how your voices will then be changed,
and how you will howl and lament at your own madness and folly. He,
who is now your merciful Saviour, will then be your inexorable Judge.
Now He is easy to be entreated; then all your tears and prayers will be
in vain. Your wealth and grandeur will stand you in no stead. You can
carry nothing of these into the other world. What horror and astonishment
will then possess your souls! Then all your lies and oaths, your
scoffs and jeers at the people of God, all your filthy and unclean thoughts
and actions, will be brought at once to your remembrance, and at once
be charged upon your guilty souls." (Sermon on a New Heart, the best
New-Year's Gift.)</p>

<p>"Alas! our great men had much rather spend their money in a play-house,
at a ball, an assembly, or a masquerade, than in relieving a poor
distressed servant of Jesus Christ. They had rather spend their estates on
their hawks and hounds, on their whores, and on their earthly, sensual, and
devilish pleasures, than in comforting, nourishing, or relieving one of their
distressed fellow-creatures. But what difference is there between the king
on the throne and the beggar on the dunghill, when God demands their
breath? There is no difference in the grave. There will be none at the
day of judgment. You will not be excused because you have had a great
estate, and a fine house, and have lived in all the pleasures that earth
could afford you. You will be judged not according to the largeness of
your estate, but according to the use you have made of it." (Sermon on
the great Duty of Charity recommended.)</p>

<p>"Sinners! how fearful soever you may be of appearing before this
tribunal, you will be obliged to do it. Then you will call for the rocks
and mountains to fall upon you, to hide you from the face of the Lord
God. Then you will see Him whom your sins have pierced. Then you
will be called to answer for your revilings and mockings against the people
of God. Then it will plainly appear who are the enthusiasts, and who the
madmen. Then we shall see who have been fools, and who were the fitter
for Bedlam." (Sermon on the Serpent's beguiling Eve.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! brethren, it is a certain, but an awful truth, that your souls will
be thinking and immortal beings, even in spite of themselves. They may
indeed torment, but they cannot destroy themselves. They can no more
suspend their power of thought and perception, than a mirror its property
of reflecting rays that fall upon its surface. Do you suspect the contrary?
Make the trial immediately. Command your minds to cease from thinking
but for one quarter of an hour. Can you succeed in that attempt? Or
rather, does not thought press in with a more sensible violence on that
resistance; just as an anxious desire to sleep makes us so much the more
wakeful? Thus will thought follow you beyond the grave. Thus will it,
as an unwelcome guest, force itself upon you, when it can serve only to
perplex and distress you. It will for ever upbraid you, that notwithstanding
the kind expostulations of God and man, notwithstanding the keen
remonstrances of conscience, and the pleadings of the blood of Christ,
you have gone on in your folly, till heaven is lost, and damnation incurred;
and all for what? for a shadow and a dream!" (Sermon on the Care of
the Soul urged as the One Thing Needful.)</p>

<p><em>Entreaties.</em>&mdash;"You all, my brethren, must be born again. You must
feel yourselves lost and undone in yourselves, or there is no salvation for
you in the Lord Jesus Christ. Men may be angry with me for telling you
these things, and may come and carry me to prison, or to death; but my
inward satisfaction at having been made instrumental of bringing any
poor sinners home to Jesus Christ, I esteem more than a balance for all
that I can suffer: If this is to be vile, I beg of God I may be yet more
vile. If this is to be mad, I pray God I may be yet more mad, in my
Master's cause. Let His own will be done in me, with me, by me, and
upon me, so I may not be brought as a witness against you in the great
day. As this is my last time of speaking to you, in this place, I would
invite you the more earnestly to come to the Lord Jesus Christ. O do
not lay the blame of your perishing upon our doctrine. Do not lay the
fault upon us; for the Lord now sends His servants to call and invite you
to Him; and if you still refuse both Him and us, what must I say? I
must appear in judgment against you; and, oh! what shall I say? The
very thought, methinks, chills my blood." (Sermon on the Necessity of
the Righteousness of Christ.)</p>

<p>"I come to you, not with the enticing words of man's wisdom, but with
plainness of speech. Perhaps many may slight me for this way of preaching;
but I am not willing to go without you to Christ. It is a love for
your better part that constrains me. O that I had ten thousand lives to
give away, that I might win you to Christ! Had I the tongue of an angel,
that I might speak so loud that the whole world could hear me, I would
bid the Christian world preach a common salvation, a common Saviour,
unto all who lay hold on Him by faith. Are you seeking where to wash?
I tell you not to go to the river Jordan, but to the blood of Christ. You
need not fear to go. Though He has given His grace to thousands, He
has still enough. Come, ye publicans; come, ye harlots; come to Jesus
Christ. O do not let me go without my errand. Do not force me to say,
'Who has believed my report?' I cannot bear the thought of it. I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
lift up my voice, like a trumpet, begging you to lay down your arms, and
to return home, that your loving Father may dress you in His spotless
robe. Come and see whether Christ will make ample recompence for all,
for more than all this world can give. Consider, if you do not, your
damnation is from yourselves. Must I weep over you, as our Saviour did
over Jerusalem? I beseech you, by all that is good and dear to you, do
not cast away your souls for ever. O mind, in this your day, the things
that belong to your peace, before they are for ever hidden from your eyes.
Could I speak with the tongues of men or angels, with all the rhetoric
possible, I could never tell the worth of Christ. He is a good Master;
indeed He is. I wish all that hear me this day would lay hold on Him,
by faith, and take Him on His own terms. Do not be angry with me for
my love. How glad would I be to bring some of you to God! Come!
He calls you by His ministers. Bring your sins with you, that He may
make you saints. He will sanctify all who believe on Him." (Sermon on
Watching, the peculiar Duty of a Christian.)</p>

<p>"Come, come unto Him. If your souls were not immortal, and you in
danger of losing them, I would not thus speak unto you; but the love of
your souls constrains me to speak. Methinks, this would constrain me to
speak unto you for ever. Come, all ye drunkards, swearers, Sabbath-breakers,
adulterers, fornicators! Come, all ye scoffers, harlots, thieves,
and murderers; and Jesus Christ will save you. He will give you rest, if
you are weary of your sins." (Sermon on Christ the only Rest for the
Weary.)</p>

<p>"O fly, fly unto the Lord Jesus Christ. I invite you all to accept of
Him. I offer Jesus Christ to the greatest profligate on earth. Surely,
there are none can say, I preach damnation now. They cannot say I am
sending you to hell now. No, my brethren, I preach salvation to all of
you, who will come and accept the Lord Jesus Christ. Oh! I know not
how to leave you, without some hopes of your coming to Him." (Sermon
on Polite and Fashionable Diversions.)</p>

<p>"The devil shews men the bait, but hides the hook. He promises
great wages; but his wages are really death here, and eternal damnation
hereafter. If you want to know more what wages the devil gives his
servants, you need not stir from the place where you now are. Look
yonder,<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> and there you will see how he pays them. He seeks your souls
to destroy them; but, my brethren, fear him not. Though he is your
enemy, he is a chained one. He can go no farther than he is permitted.
He could not hurt a herd of swine, till he had leave of Jesus Christ."
(Sermon on the Danger of Man resulting from Sin.)</p></blockquote>

<p>These are long extracts, at the end of an inconveniently
long chapter; but, it must be borne in mind, that, the fame
of Whitefield chiefly rests on his character as a preacher;
and that there are only thirty-five of his published sermons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
which belong to dates subsequent to the year 1739; and
that even more than half of these were taken from his lips,
in shorthand, and printed without his revision or consent.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to enlarge upon the foregoing
extracts. The reader can form his own opinions of Whitefield's
oratory, courage, tenderness, earnestness, and fidelity.
He can also judge of the young preacher's imprudence,
perhaps rudeness, in using language so violent concerning
the clergy of the Established Church. One fact, however,
must be noted. These sermons, as <em>originally published</em>,
contain scarcely any allusion whatever to Calvinian tenets.
Whitefield, no doubt, became a Calvinist; but this change in
his theology did not occur, until he was about to embark, the
second time, for Georgia. Indeed, though, in the seventeen
sermons which remain unnoticed, and which were written
and revised by Whitefield himself, there are passages embodying
the doctrines of election and final perseverance;
also passages on imputed righteousness and sinless perfection,
propounding views not in harmony with those of his friend
Wesley; yet such passages, comparatively speaking, are few
in number, and are totally exempt from bitterness. It is
also right to add, that, Whitefield's Calvinism never interfered
with his warmhearted declarations concerning the
<em>universality</em> of redeeming love, and the willingness of Christ
to save <em>all</em> who come to Him. Doubtless there was some
degree of inconsistency in this; but it only shews that the
man's heart was larger than his creed.</p>

<p>Excepting two or three, there is nothing in the remaining
seventeen sermons just mentioned which requires further
notice. They are, however, in most respects, his ablest and
his best. There is less incoherency of thought and language.
There is an entire absence of attacks on the clergy of the
Church of England. The style is more polished; the sentences
more finished. There is more biblical and anecdotal
illustration. And there is a greater depth of religious feeling
and experience.</p>

<p>Excellent, however, as <em>these</em> sermons are, they necessarily
fail to convey a full idea of Whitefield's marvellous preaching
power. His words could be printed, but not his intonations,
action, tears, smiles, solemnity, and pathos. Whitefield was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
born an orator. His oratory was the gift of his Creator.
He could not be natural without using it. To have laid
it aside would have been affectation. His oratory, however,
is a thing not to be seen in his published sermons, but to be
imagined. There was eloquence in his very attitudes, in the
accents of his voice, in his gestures, in the features of his
face, and in the motions of his hands. These things could
not be printed. To say nothing of his almost unequalled
voice, his versatility was wonderful. At will, he could be a
Boanerges, or a Barnabas. One moment, he would thunder
on Mount Sinai; the next, would whisper mercy on Mount
Calvary. At all times, he was inexpressibly earnest, and his
hearers felt he believed the truths he uttered. A writer, in
the <cite>New York Observer</cite>, eloquently observes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We read Whitefield's printed sermons, and they disappoint us. Of
all men in the world, he was the last who should have published his
sermons. So much did he owe to physical temperament, to the volume
and varied intonations of his voice, to the irrepressible fires of a soul all
alive to the grand and overpowering visions of divine truth, to a sort of
inspiration kindled by the sight of thousands whose eyes were ready to
weep and whose hearts were ready to break the moment his clarion voice
rang out on their expectant ears&mdash;so much did he owe to these circumstances,
that his eloquence cannot be appreciated by any account of it
which can be given verbally, or be delineated on paper. Vain is it, therefore,
to look into his printed sermons to find his power. His power as a
pulpit orator, also, cannot be separated from his pious emotions, nor from
his religious views. Had he embraced a theory of religion less emotional,
more after the pattern of rationalists or ritualists, his eloquence would
have been lost to the world. Never would his soul have taken fire, nor
his lips glowed with the burning coal of enthusiastic passion. But he
believed in man's ruin by sin, in the certain interminable woe that awaited
the impenitent; in the mercy of God through Jesus Christ, and the free
offer of salvation through faith in the cross. Such were his views, and,
under these convictions, he looked upon his audiences. He saw but one
hope set before them, and with his whole soul moved and melted by the
love of Christ on the one hand, and the love of souls on the other, he
pressed every hearer, with all the energy of a dying man speaking to
dying men, to accept the great salvation. Nor do we think that the pulpit
can reach its appropriate power, nor for any length of time retain it, unless
these grand cardinal doctrines of grace are the inspiring themes."</p></blockquote>

<p>These remarks are as just as they are eloquent; but it
is now time to follow Whitefield in his transatlantic wanderings.</p>

<p>Marvellous were the scenes which Whitefield had
witnessed during the last few months. If ministerial
success were a proof that the man thus honoured ought to
remain where he is, Whitefield ought to have remained in
England. He had, however, formally accepted the distant
living of Savannah. The Trustees of Georgia had cheerfully
acceded to all his wishes. He had collected considerable
sums of money for the erection of his contemplated
Orphanage. He had promised the people of Savannah
that he would return to them. People on both sides the
Atlantic expected this. On the other hand, and despite
the ribald persecutions to which he had been subjected,
he had strong inducements to stay at home. Hundreds,
perhaps thousands, during the last half-year, had been converted
by his ministry, and needed pastoral attention. The
crowds that flocked to hear him had not at all diminished,
but were as great as ever. Multitudes wished to keep him.
To fill his place was extremely difficult, perhaps impossible.
But solemn promises had been made; and, in accordance
with these, public, as well as private, arrangements had taken
place; all rendering a return to Georgia an imperative necessity.
No doubt, Whitefield was anxious that the great
work, which had been begun in London and elsewhere, should
be conserved, and be carried on; and he seems to have
requested Charles Wesley to act as his successor. At all
events, Charles wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

under me, and appeared, throughout my discourse, under the strongest
perturbation of mind. In our return, we were much delighted with an old
spiritual Quaker, who is clear in justification by faith only. At Marylebone,
a footman was convinced of more than sin; and now waits with confidence
for all the power of faith. Friend Keen seems to have experience, and is
right in the foundation.</p>

<p>"I cannot preach out on the week-days, for the expense of coach; nor
accept of dear Mr. Seward's offer; to which I should be less backward,
would he take my advice. But while he is so lavish of his Lord's goods,
I cannot consent that this ruin should, in any degree, <em>seem</em> to be under
my hand.</p>

<p>"I am continually tempted to leave off preaching, and hide myself like
J. Hutchins. I should then be freer from temptation, and at leisure to
attend to my own improvement. God continues to work <em>by</em> me, but not <em>in</em>
me, that I can perceive. Do not reckon upon me, my brother, in the
work God is doing: for I cannot expect He should long employ one who
is ever longing and murmuring to be discharged. I rejoice in your success,
and pray for its increase a thousand-fold."<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Four days after the date of this letter, Whitefield embarked
for America. His party consisted of seventeen persons,
including Mr. Seward and himself.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> One of these was Joseph
Periam, whom Whitefield had rescued from a madhouse.
Another was Mr. Gladman, a captain, whose ship, during
Whitefield's first visit to America, had been thrown upon a
sandbank, near the Gulf of Florida, where he and his crew
had to exist, as they best could, for thirty days, when they
launched a raft; and, after floating about a hundred and
forty leagues, came to Tybee Island, near Savannah. Whitefield
shewed the captain kindness. They returned to England
in the same ship. The man was converted. Many situations
were offered him; but he declined them all, gave himself to
the work of God, and was now one of Whitefield's companions
to Georgia.</p>

<p>The voyage was of eleven weeks' continuance; but was
not marked by any notable occurrence. Whitefield had
public prayers twice a day. On Sundays, he preached and
administered the sacrament. Sometimes, he and his friends
held a love-feast; and, on several occasions, he allowed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Quaker to preach in his cabin. Often he suffered deep
depression, and was profoundly humbled by revelations of
his sinfulness in the sight of God. A large portion of his
time was spent in writing letters, so that, when he landed,
he had more than sixty ready for the post.</p>

<p>One of these, now for the first time published, was
addressed to Mr. Blackwell, the Lombard Street banker:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Blackwell</span>,&mdash;I must write you, though so lately parted
from you. I know the temptations which surround you. If I love you, I
must watch over your soul. Perhaps, ere now, your father is launched
into eternity. Yet a little while, you and I must follow. Oh, let us live
the life of the righteous, that our future state may be like his. Nothing
but a living faith in Jesus Christ can support us in a dying hour. What
would the self-righteous Pharisees of this generation give for this pearl of
inestimable price when God takes away their souls? Oh, my dear friend,
it is worth being laughed at. It is worth ten thousand worlds. You will
not think much then of renouncing one world for it. You have put your
hand to the plough: I know you will scorn to look back. Your carnal
relatives will do their utmost to make you ashamed of the cross of Christ;
but be not ashamed of it, for it is the power of God unto salvation.
Neither be ashamed of His disciples, though men of low degree, and
accounted fools for His sake. No, rather choose to suffer affliction with
His people; for, if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him. Oh, let your
delight be with the saints that are in the earth, and with them that excel
in virtue. You are blessed with many such. I beseech you, by the mercies
of God in Christ Jesus our Lord, forsake not the assembling of yourselves
together. And, as in my presence, so in my absence, see that you work
out your salvation with fear and trembling. Let Jesus Christ be the Alpha
and Omega, the beginning and the end of all your thoughts, words, and
actions. Suffer Him to work His whole will in, by, and upon you. And
fail not writing to, and praying for,</p>

<p>Extracts from a few other letters, written during the
voyage to America, may be useful. The first was addressed
to Charles Wesley:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Honoured and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;God has been pleased to send us a
comfortable passage. The Orphan House accounts come right within £10.</p>

<p>I have great assurances given me that it will be a Pietas Georgiensis,
equally remarkable with the Pietas Hallensis. I shall continue in Georgia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
above six months. If Mr. Hutchins would come to supply my place, I
would keep the parsonage of Savannah. Otherwise, I will resign all but
the Orphan House. I have read Guise and Doddridge on the Evangelists,
and written to both. The former I think excellent; the latter,
ingenious, elaborate, but too superficial. Neal's 'Lives of the Puritans'
have been of use. I think they held the truth as it is in Jesus. The
Quakers have set us an example of patient, resolute suffering, as the best
means to weary our enemies. I want the Lives of Luther and Calvin,
to get some short account of the history of the Reformation. At my
return, I trust I shall speak boldly, as I ought to speak. The account of
my infant years was written by the will of God. Pray, let it be published,
without any material diminution or addition. He who hideth his sins shall
not prosper. My Letter to the Religious Societies I give to the schools
at Bristol. The Lord prosper the work of your hands upon you! I have
written to the Bishop of Gloucester, and have delivered my soul, by
meekly telling him of his faults. I long to hear how affairs go on in
England. Are you yet the Lord's prisoner? If they make any laws
whatsoever, I trust notwithstanding I shall preach with all boldness. Oh,
dear sir, pray publicly, as well as in private, for your unworthy, loving
servant,</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>To other friends, Whitefield wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Our ship is now going to the Downs. God strengthens me mightily
in the inner man. The sermon I have sent you is one of my extempore
sermons. My brother, the captain, has been with me this last week. If
he leaves off disputing, and will come to Christ as a poor lost sinner, he
will do well. The Bishop of London has lately written against me. I
trust God has assisted me in writing an answer. It is now (August 14)
in the press. All the self-righteous are up in arms. My Master makes
me more than a conqueror through His love. Mr. Ingham has about
forty Societies in Yorkshire. Both the Mr. Wesleys go on well. Go
where you will, religion (either for or against it) is the talk. Probably a
suffering time will come. You will not be ashamed of me, though I should
be a prisoner. Soon after this reaches Georgia, I hope to see you. My
stay will be as short as possible at Philadelphia. I must not delay coming
to my dear, though poor, charge. I expect to find Savannah almost
desolate;<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> but our extremity is God's opportunity. I believe it will lift
up its drooping head."</p>

<p>"I thank God for His goodness to brother Howell Harris. The storm
is diverted for a while, but I expect it to break upon my head one time
or another. God has, for a while, prepared me a place of refuge in the
ship from whence I write this. I have almost forgotten that I was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
world. My family on board is quite settled, and we live and love like
Christians. I am now reading the 'Book of Martyrs.' They make me
blush to think how little I suffer for Christ's sake. They warm my heart,
and make me think the time long till I am called to resist even unto blood.
But I fear the treachery of this heart of mine."</p>

<p>"Since my retirement from the world, I have seen more and more how
full I am of corruption. Nothing could possibly support my soul under
the many agonies which oppress me, but a consideration of the freeness,
eternity, and unchangeableness of God's love to me, the chief of sinners.
In about a twelvemonth, probably, I shall return again to my native
country. Satan, no doubt, will endeavour to stir up all his forces against
me. By the help of my God, I will once more come forth with my sling
and my stone. I shall wait with impatience to hear how the work goes
on in my absence. I trust God, by this time (Nov. 10), has sent more
labourers into His harvest. I verily believe the right hand of the Lord
will bring mighty things to pass. O how do I long to see bigotry and
party-zeal taken away, and all the Lord's servants more knit together!"</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;When with you last, I thought you spoke
too favourably of horse-races and such things. But what diversion ought
a Christian or a clergyman to know, or speak of, but that of doing good?
Many who are right in their principles, are worse than I could wish in
their practice. O for a revival of true and undefiled religion in all sects
whatsoever! I long to see a catholic spirit overspread the world. May
God vouchsafe to make me an instrument in promoting it! Methinks, I
care not what I do or suffer, so that I may see my Lord's kingdom come
with power."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following is taken from a letter to the Erskines and
their confederates in Scotland:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Though I know none of you in person, yet, from the time I heard of
your faith and love towards our dear Lord Jesus, I have been acquainted
with you in spirit, and have constantly mentioned you in my poor prayers.
I find the good pleasure of the Lord prospers in your hands; and I pray
God to increase you more and more. Scotland, like England, has been
so much settled upon its lees for some time, that I fear our late days may
properly be called the midnight of the Church. I cannot but think a
winnowing time will come after this ingathering of souls. O that we may
suffer only as Christians, and then the Spirit of Christ and of glory will
rest upon us. In patience possess your souls. I will leave my cause to
God. The eternal God will be your perpetual refuge. He who employs
will protect. As your day is, so shall your strength be."<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>
<p>Other friends were addressed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The innumerable temptations, that attend a popular life, sometimes
make me think it would be best for me to withdraw. But then, I consider
that He who delivered Daniel out of the den of lions, and the three children
out of the fiery furnace, is able and willing to deliver me also out of the
fiery furnace of popularity and applause, and from the fury of those, who,
for preaching Christ and Him crucified, are my inveterate enemies. In
His strength, therefore, and at His command, when His providence shall
call, I will venture out again. As yet, my trials have been nothing. Hereafter,
a winnowing time may come; and then we shall see who is on the
Lord's side, and who dare to confess Christ before men."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The Christian world is in a deep sleep.
Nothing but a loud voice can awaken them out of it. It would rejoice
me to hear of your success in the Lord. In about a twelvemonth, I purpose
to return to England. I long to die unto myself, and to be alive unto God.
Methinks, I would always be upon the wing; but, alas! I have a body of
sin, which, at times, makes me cry out, 'Who shall deliver me?' I thank
God, our Lord Jesus Christ will deliver. But I never expect entire freedom
till I bow down my head, and give up the ghost. Every fresh employ,
I find, brings with it fresh temptations. God always humbles before He
exalts me. Sometimes I speak and write freely, at other times I am
comparatively barren; one while on the mount, another while overshadowed
with a cloud; but, blessed be God! at all times, at peace with
Him, and assured that my sins are forgiven. I want to leap my seventy
years. I long to be dissolved, and to be with Christ. But I must be
made perfect by sufferings. I expect no other preferment."</p></blockquote>

<p>In a letter to Mr. Hutchins, one of the Oxford Methodists,
Whitefield wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And how does my dear Mr. Hutchins? Is he yet commenced a
field-preacher? I am persuaded my dear friend is under the guidance of
God's Spirit, and, therefore, am convinced he will be directed for the best.
Ere now, I trust, he has been upon many a mount, stretching out his
hands, and inviting all that are weary and heavy-laden to come to Jesus
Christ. In about a twelvemonth, I think of returning to England. I
should rejoice if you would come and supply my place at Savannah. If
not, I must resign the parsonage, and take upon me only the care of the
orphans. I intend bringing up two or three, who are with me, for the
ministry: more, no doubt, will shortly be added to their number. If you
could come and teach them the languages, for an hour or two in the day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
we could serve both the Orphan House and Parsonage together. Great
things I trust will come out of Georgia."</p>

<p>"I know so much of the corruption of my heart, that, were God to leave
me to myself but one moment, I should with oaths and curses deny my
Master. As for my final perseverance, I bless God, I have not the least
doubt thereof. The gifts and callings of God are without repentance.
Whom He loves, I am persuaded, He loves to the end. But then, I fear
lest, being puffed up with abundance of success, I should provoke the
Lord to let me fall into some heinous sin, and thereby give His adversaries
reason to rejoice. A public life is attended with innumerable snares; and
a sense of my unworthiness and unfitness so weighs me down, that I have
often thought it would be best for me to retire. But I know these are all
suggestions of the enemy. Why should I distrust Omnipotence? Having
had a legion of devils cast out of my heart by the power of Christ, why
should I not tell what He hath done for my soul, for the encouragement
of others? By the help of God, I will speak. The more Satan bids me
hold my peace, the more earnestly will I proclaim to believing saints, that
Jesus will have mercy on them. Oh! had I a thousand lives, my dear
Lord Jesus should have them all."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following seems to have been written to certain
students at Oxford:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Look round, look round, my brethren, and, in imitation of your common
Lord, weep over the desolations of the University wherein you live. Alas!
how is that once faithful city become a harlot! Have pity upon her, ye
that are friends; and, whatever treatment you may meet with from an
ungrateful world, endeavour to rescue some of her sons out of that blindness,
ignorance, bigotry, and formality, into which she is unhappily fallen.
Arise, ye sons of the prophets. Shine forth, ye who are appointed to be
the lights of the world. The rulers of this world will endeavour to put
you under bushels; but, if your light is of God's kindling, all the devils
in hell shall not be able to extinguish it. How will you be apt to teach
hereafter, unless you begin to teach now? All God's people will wish
you God speed. I am sure I do with all my heart."</p></blockquote>

<p>The next extract is from a letter addressed to the students
of a Dissenting college&mdash;perhaps Dr. Doddridge's:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As God has been pleased to bless my ministry to your souls, I think
it my duty to watch over you for good. I heartily pray that you may be
burning and shining lights in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation.
Though you are not of the Church of England, yet, if you are
persuaded in your own minds of the truth of the way wherein you walk,
I leave it. Whether <em>Conformists</em> or <em>Nonconformists</em>, our main concern
should be, to be assured that we are called and taught of God; for none
but such are fit to minister in holy things. It rejoiced me much to see
such dawnings of grace in your souls; only I thought most of you were
bowed down too much with a servile fear of man: but, as the love of the
Creator increases, the fear of the creature will decrease. Unless your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
hearts are free from worldly hopes and worldly fears, you will never speak
boldly, as you ought to speak. The good old Puritans, I believe, never
preached better than when in danger of being taken to prison as soon as
they had finished their sermons; and, I am persuaded, unless you go
forth with the same temper, you will never preach with the same demonstration
of the Spirit, and of power. Study your hearts as well as books.
Ask yourselves, again and again, whether you would preach for Christ, if
you were sure to lay down your lives for so doing. But enough of this.
I love to hope well of you all."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following was addressed to Howell Harris, and shews
that Whitefield was now a Calvinist. While Harris was
preaching at Pontypool, in the month of June, an officious
official came and read the Riot Act, though there was not
the least likelihood of a riot taking place. Harris asked
him if he was accustomed to read the Act at "cock-matches"?
This increased the man's anger, and Harris was arrested,
carried before a magistrate, and committed for trial, at Monmouth
Assizes, in August following. Having procured bail for
his appearance, he surrendered himself at the proper time;
but no evidence whatever was produced against him, and,
of course, he was dismissed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I congratulate you on your success at Monmouth. God has yet
further work for you to do, ere you are called before rulers and governors,
for His name's sake. In about a twelvemonth, I hope to make a second
use of your field-pulpits. Our principles agree, as face answers to face in
the water. Since I saw you, God has been pleased to enlighten me more
in that comfortable doctrine of <em>election</em>, etc. At my return, I hope to be
more explicit than I have been. God forbid, my dear brother, that we
should shun to declare the whole counsel of God!"</p></blockquote>

<p>The next extract also expresses the same sentiments:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What was there in you, and in me, that should move God to choose
us before others? Was there any fitness foreseen in us, except a fitness
for damnation? I believe not. No, God chose us from eternity; He
called us in time; and, I am persuaded, will keep us from falling finally,
till time shall be no more. Consider the gospel in this view, and it appears
a consistent scheme."</p></blockquote>

<p>In a letter to Hervey, Whitefield wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The many happy hours I spent with you at Oxon, and the benefit I
have received from your instructions and example, are yet fresh upon my
memory. I long to have my dear friend come forth and preach the
truth as it is in Jesus. Not a righteousness or inward holiness of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
own, whereby we may make ourselves meet, but the righteousness of
another, even the Lord our righteousness; upon the imputation and
apprehending of which by faith, we shall be made meet, by His Holy
Spirit, to live with, and to enjoy God. Let me advise dear Mr. Hervey
to lay aside all prejudice, and to read and pray over St. Paul's Epistles to
the Romans and Galatians; and then let him tell me what he thinks of
this doctrine. Most of your old friends are now happily enlightened.
God sets His seal to such preaching in an extraordinary manner, and, I
am persuaded, the gates of hell shall never be able to prevail against it.
O that dear Mr. Hervey would also join with us! O that the Lord would
open his eyes to behold aright this part of the mystery of godliness! How
would it rejoice my heart! how would it comfort his own soul! I have
written to dear Mr. Orchard,<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> as well as to you, out of the simplicity of my
heart."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following refers to the painful mental exercises through
which Whitefield passed during his voyage to America:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Searcher of all hearts alone knows what agonies of soul I have
undergone since my retirement from the world. The remembrance of
my past sins has overwhelmed me, and caused tears to be my meat day
and night. Indeed, I have mourned as one mourneth for a firstborn;
but I looked to Him whom I have pierced. I was enabled to see the
freeness and riches of His grace, the infiniteness and eternity of His love;
and my soul received comfort. O the excellency of the doctrine of election,
and of the saints' final perseverance, to those who are sealed by the
Spirit of promise! I am persuaded, till a man comes to believe and feel
these important truths, he cannot come out of himself; but, when convinced
of these, and assured of the application of them to his own heart,
he then walks by faith indeed, not in himself, but in the Son of God, who
died and gave Himself for him."</p></blockquote>

<p>The next extract is from a letter to the father of Joseph
Periam, whose incarceration in a madhouse has been already
mentioned:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Though unknown to you in person, yet, as you were pleased to think
me worthy of the care of your dear son, I think it my duty to acquaint
you of his welfare. I bless God that he came with me. He is diligent
and pious, and, I trust, will be a comfort to you in your declining years.
His mind seems settled and composed; and, by reading and following
the Bible, he is a partaker of that peace which the world cannot give.
His dear and honoured father is much upon his heart. How would it
rejoice him to hear that you also were become a Christian indeed! Be
not offended, dear sir, at my expressing myself thus. Christianity is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
than a name and a bare outward profession. Morality of itself will never
carry us to heaven. No, Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life.
There is no being happy without a lively faith in Him, wrought in the
heart by the blessed Spirit of God. This faith transforms the whole man,
delivers him from the tyranny of his passions, and makes him entirely a
new creature. This is the reason why it is foolishness to the world.
Your son's case, in this respect, was not singular. As soon as ever we
commence Christians, we commence fools for Christ's sake. Every truly
religious man must be deemed a madman."<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the month of June, 1739, in a letter to a friend, Wesley
made use of the memorable declaration, which has been
quoted times without number, "I look upon all the world as
my parish." In the following extract, Whitefield employs
the same expression, thus shewing that it was not peculiar
to Wesley, but common among the Oxford Methodists:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The whole world is now my parish. Wheresoever my Master calls
me, I am ready to go and preach His everlasting gospel. My only grief
is that I cannot do more for Christ. I ought to love and do much, having
had so much forgiven. Oh pray, dear sir, that I may never be weary in
well-doing."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the following paragraph Whitefield shews his intention
in reference to the parish of Savannah:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I intend resigning the parsonage of Savannah. The Orphan House
I can take care of, supposing I should be kept at a distance. Besides,
when I have resigned the parish, I shall be more at liberty to make a
tour round America, if God should ever call me to such a work. However,
I determine nothing; I wait on the Lord. I am persuaded He will shew
me what is His will. How earnestly do I desire to be dissolved, that I
may be with Christ! Sometimes, my weak body gives me hopes that I
shall not be long in the flesh; but then, the strength that is communicated
to me, and the consideration that I have but just begun my testimony,
fill me with fears, lest I should live to be grey-headed. But I endeavour
to resign myself wholly to God. If He preserves me from falling into sin,
and from dishonouring His holy name, let Him do what seemeth Him
good with me."</p></blockquote>

<p>These extracts are "odds and ends;" but they are useful,
as unfolding Whitefield's character and principles, his opinions
and intentions, the state of his mind and heart, after his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
wondrous services in England, and during his voyage to
America. Another letter, or rather pastoral epistle, written
at this period, demands a more lengthened notice. It was
published soon afterwards, with the following title: "A
Letter from the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield, to the Religious
Societies lately set on foot in several parts of England and
Wales. Wrote on board the <em>Elizabeth</em>, Captain Stevenson,
during the voyage to Philadelphia, 1739. Edinburgh:
printed for James Beugo, Bookseller, in Dumferling, 1740."<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
(26 pp.) Whitefield had been closely associated with these
Societies in London, Bristol, and elsewhere; he highly approved
of them; and it was natural to expect that he would
take a profound interest in their continued existence and
prosperity. The reader must be content with short extracts
from this long epistle.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Legality of the Religious Societies.</em>&mdash;"If you fear God, and truly honour
the king, and are of the number of those who are quiet in the land, no
reason can be urged against your Societies. In this respect, a private
prelate has no more authority than a private presbyter. If it be lawful
for more than five to meet in a private vestry, it is equally lawful for more
than five to meet in a private house; as is the practice of some of the
Societies, who are under the government of those called the Twelve
Stewards. If it be enquired of you, 'By what authority you sometimes
pray without a premeditated form of words?' you may enquire, 'By what
authority any one reads the Church Forms, who is not commissioned so
to do, and that in any place but in the church, where only they are
appointed to be read, and only by one so commissioned?' If they reply,
'You have Dr. Woodward's Form;' you may answer them with this question,
'What difference is there, in respect to others, between a person's
reading a form, which few who hear it know beforehand, and a person's
praying extempore, as the Holy Spirit gives him utterance?' If they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
laugh at the mention of 'praying by the Spirit,' I hope you know better.
Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith Christ has made you free;
and be not afraid to make innovations in the Church, which does not
confine its members to forms, except within the walls of the church, nor
even there altogether."</p>

<p><em>Admission of new members.</em>&mdash;"You ought to be <em>very cautious</em> whom
you admit into fellowship with you. Examine them again and again, not
barely whether they receive the sacrament, and go to church, but whether
they be in the faith. Set them upon proving their own selves; and by
no means receive them into your brotherhood, unless they can produce
sufficient evidences of their having tasted the good word of life, and felt
the powers of the world to come. Some may object that this is not a
very good way to increase and multiply you as to number; but it is the
best, the only way, to establish and increase a communion of true saints.
Such a Society, consisting of a few solid Christians, is far preferable to
one that is filled with a multitude of such as do not bring forth fruit unto
holiness, but have only the fig-leaves of an outward profession. Formal
hypocrites will do any Society more harm than good."</p>

<p><em>Object of their meetings.</em>&mdash;"The end of your meeting is not that you
may think yourselves more holy than your neighbours, much less to form
a sect or party, or to promote a schism or sedition in the Church or State.
No: such thoughts, I trust, are far from you; for they are earthly, sensual,
devilish. The only end which I hope you all propose by your assembling
yourselves together, is the renewing of your depraved natures, and promoting
the hidden life of Jesus Christ in your souls."</p>

<p><em>Doctrine.</em>&mdash;"I think it my bounden duty to exhort you to contend
earnestly for the doctrine of <em>justification by faith only</em>, because so many
blind guides are lately gone out into the world. It is much to be feared
that many of our present preachers are no better than doctrinal papists.
One of the most reputed orthodox prelates in the kingdom, in a late
pastoral letter, advises his clergy, 'so to explain the doctrine of justification
in the sight of God by faith only, as to make good works a
necessary condition.' Such advice from a Roman cardinal would be no
more than we might expect; but, coming from a bishop of the Church
of England, is surprising, and much to be lamented. God forbid that
you should so learn Christ! No, my brethren, in the great mystery of
man's redemption by Jesus Christ, boasting is entirely excluded. We
must not expect to be saved, or in any way to recommend ourselves to
God, by any or all the works of righteousness which we have done, or
shall, or can do. The Lord Christ is our righteousness, our whole
righteousness&mdash;imputed to us, instead of our own. 'We are accounted
righteous before God, only for the merits of our Lord Jesus Christ, by
faith,' saith the eleventh article of our Church. Observe, my brethren,
justified <em>by</em> or <em>through</em> faith, and not <em>for</em> faith; for faith is only a means
or instrument whereby the whole righteousness of Jesus Christ is applied
to the sinner's soul. Whosoever thus believes may be assured that his
pardon is sealed in heaven, notwithstanding he has lived in an open
breach of God's commandments all his lifetime before. This faith, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
will not be dead, idle, or inactive; for it is not a faith of the head,
or a bare assent to things credible as credible; the devils thus believe
and tremble; but it is a faith of the heart, a living principle of new life,
infused into the soul by the Spirit of God, applying that inwardly, which
was wrought for him outwardly by the obedience and death of Jesus
Christ, and continually exciting the possessor of it to shew it forth by his
works; not as necessary conditions, but as proofs of his justification in
the sight of God; and as so many tokens of his gratitude and love for
what God has done for his soul."</p>

<p><em>Christian fellowship.</em>&mdash;"Content not yourselves with reading, singing,
and praying together; but set some time apart to confess your faults,
and to communicate your experience one to another. For want of this,
(which I take to be one chief design of private meetings), most of the old
Societies in London, I fear, are sunk into a dead formality, and have only
a name to live. They meet on a Sabbath evening, read a chapter, and
sing a psalm; but seldom, if ever, acquaint each other with the operations
of God's Spirit upon their souls; notwithstanding this was the great
end of those who first began these Societies. Hence it is, that, they have
only the form of godliness left amongst them, and continue utter strangers
to the state of one another's hearts. My brethren, let not your coming
together be thus altogether in vain, but plainly and freely tell one another
what God has done for your souls. To this end, you would do well, as
others have done, to form yourselves into little companies of four or five
each, and meet once a week to tell each other what is in your hearts;
that you may then also pray for, and comfort each other, as need shall
require. None but those who have experienced it, can tell the unspeakable
advantages of such a union and communion of souls. I know not a
better means in the world to keep hypocrisy out from amongst you.
Pharisees and unbelievers will pray, read, and sing psalms; but none,
save an Israelite indeed, will endure to have his heart searched out."</p></blockquote>

<p>Counsels like these are always in season. Whitefield
never instituted class-meetings, in the same sense as his
friend Wesley did; but he strenuously urged the use of that
Christian fellowship, which was the chief object of such
meetings when they were first commenced. The reader will
do well, in this age of ritualistic formality, to ponder some
of the points in Whitefield's "Letter to the Religious Societies
of England, in 1739."</p>

<p>Enough has been written to shew the views and feelings
with which Whitefield returned to America, in 1739. He,
William Seward, and another friend, landed at Lewis Town,
about a hundred and fifty miles from Philadelphia, on October
30. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"God is the great householder of the whole world, and I look upon all
persons as so many parts of His great family. As there is here the same
sun, so there is here the same God&mdash;in America as in England. I would
have all places alike to me, so I am where God would have me to be;
but I hope I shall never account myself at home till I arrive at my
heavenly Father's house above. I trust my heart is there already. Oh,
when shall I shake off this earthly tabernacle! It sadly confines my
soul. Lord, help me patiently to tarry till my blessed change comes!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Next day the young evangelist, by request, preached "to
a serious and attentive congregation;" and, at five in the
afternoon, he and his two friends set out for Philadelphia,
the place to which the ship, they had left, was bound. After
a ride of twenty-seven miles through the woods, they came,
at ten o'clock at night, to what was called a tavern. The
host and hostess made them a cake of unleavened bread, and
set before them a few eggs and a little cider, and they went
to bed rejoicing.</p>

<p>The day following, they rode fifty miles, and "came to a
more convenient inn." Whitefield says, "Our Lord comforted
us as we came on our way; and our hearts burned
within us whilst we talked to one another in psalms and
hymns and spiritual songs."</p>

<p>On the third day, they reached Philadelphia, where the
<em>Elizabeth</em>, with what Whitefield calls his "family," had
arrived in safety.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania, of which Philadelphia was the capital, was
an English settlement about two hundred and fifty miles in
length, and nearly the same in breadth.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> As is well known,
this large extent of territory had been granted to William
Penn, the Quaker, about sixty years previous to Whitefield's
visit. In 1682, Penn began to found his important colony.
The soil, in general, was extremely fertile. Game of all
kinds was amazingly plentiful. Deer, hares, turkeys,
pheasants, partridges, wild ducks, wild geese, swans, and
pigeons, were innumerable. In the immense forests, were
bears, panthers, wild cats, and wolves; while, in the low
grounds, were found minks, musk rats, and opossums. The
woods consisted of the oak, the ash, the beech, the chestnut,
the cedar, the walnut, the cypress, the hickory, the sassafras,
and the pine,&mdash;all of which, in many instances, were gracefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
festooned with vines. Fruits, including apples, cherries,
pears, peaches, plums, and melons, grew in rich abundance.
Penn's colony originally consisted chiefly of English Quakers,
who, in consequence of their refusing to pay tithes and
church dues, had frequently found themselves the inmates
of English prisons. These, together with a few Dutch and
Swedish settlers already on the ground, began to transform
this glorious wilderness into a cultivated land. The Indians&mdash;the
original proprietors&mdash;were treated with justice and
kindness. Religious and civil freedom was made the basis
of government. All persons professing to believe in one
God were freely tolerated; and all who professed to believe
in Jesus Christ, of whatever denomination, were eligible for
government posts and offices. The result was, emigrants
and refugees, of all persuasions, flocked to Pennsylvania, to
put themselves under the protection of its founder's laws;
lands were cultivated; towns were built; and when Penn
died, about twenty years before Whitefield's first visit, the
colony was, in every sense, free and flourishing.</p>

<p>In 1739, the population of Pennsylvania was probably
not more than from fifty to a hundred thousand,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> and consisted
of Quakers, Episcopalians, Calvinists, Lutherans, Independents,
Baptists, Presbyterians, and "Dumplers, a sort of
German sect, who wore long beards and a habit resembling
that of Friars." As might be expected, governmental power
was chiefly in the hands of Quakers, and, with rare exceptions,
it was humanely exercised.</p>

<p>Philadelphia, the chief town of the colony, stood upon a
neck of land, immediately at the confluence of the rivers
Delaware and Schuylkill. It was planned in an oblong
form, and designed to extend two miles, from river to river
There were to be eight parallel streets, all two miles in
length, to be intersected by sixteen others, each in length a
mile, and all of them broad, spacious, and even; with proper
spaces left for the public buildings, churches, and market
places. In the centre was a square of ten acres. The two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
principal streets were each one hundred feet wide; and most
of the houses had a small garden and orchard attached to
them. When William Penn began his work in 1682,
Philadelphia consisted of three or four insignificant cottages.
"Conies were yet undisturbed in their hereditary burrows;
the deer fearlessly bounded past blazed trees, unconscious of
foreboded streets; and the stranger that wandered from the
river bank was lost in the thickets of an interminable forest.
Two years afterwards, the place contained about six hundred
houses, and the schoolmaster and the printing-press had
begun their work."<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> In 1761, the population of Philadelphia
was about 13,000.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>The state of religion, in Pennsylvania, was lamentable.
The Rev. Samuel Blair, a Presbyterian minister, living at
the time, observes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There were some sincerely religious people, and a considerable number
pretty exact in the observance of the external forms of religion; but
with this, the most part seemed to rest contented, and to satisfy their
consciences with a dead formality. A lamentable ignorance of the main
essentials of true practical religion, and the doctrines relating thereto,
generally prevailed. The nature and necessity of the new birth were but
little known or thought of. The necessity of a conviction of sin and
misery, in order to a saving closure with Christ, was hardly known at all.
It was thought that, if there was any need of a heart-distressing sight of
the soul's danger, it was only needful for the grosser sort of sinners; and
for any others to be thus deeply exercised, was generally looked upon to
be a great evil and temptation. There was scarcely any suspicion of the
danger of depending upon self-righteousness, and not upon the righteousness
of Christ alone, for salvation. The necessity of being first in Christ
by a vital union, and in a justified state, before our religious services can
be well-pleasing and acceptable to God, was very little understood. The
common notion seemed to be, that, if people were aiming to be in the
way of duty as well as they could, there was no reason to be much afraid.
According to these principles, people generally were careless at heart,
and stupidly indifferent about the great concerns of eternity. It was sad
to see with what a careless behaviour the public ordinances were attended,
and how people were given to worldly discourse on the Lord's-day. In
public companies, a vain and frothy lightness was apparent in the deportment
of many professors. Religion, as it were, lay a-dying, and
ready to expire its last breath of life in this part of the visible church."<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>
<p>It is hoped that this brief account of Pennsylvania will
not be thought irrelevant. It was here that Whitefield
began his itinerant career in England's transatlantic colonies.
During the four months he had spent in Georgia, in 1738,
his ministry had been earnest, but regular. Now, in Pennsylvania,
he became what he had been, for seven months in
England, not a fixed star, but a flaming comet, his course
eccentric, and calculated to alarm episcopal, presbyterian,
and other kinds of precisians in the English settlements,
quite as much as the same sort of methodical religionists
had been alarmed in England. In both countries his action
was unpremeditated. On his return to England, at the end
of 1738, he had not the least idea of becoming an open-air
and itinerant evangelist. He came to be ordained a priest,
and to collect subscriptions for his contemplated Orphan
House. In like manner, when he returned to America in
1739, he had no conception that the next fourteen months
would be occupied as they were. He was intentionally
returning to Savannah, there, for about a year, to fulfil the
duties of his office as a regular appointed minister of the
Church of England, and also, in such a capacity, to provide
a home for the orphans of his parish. Instead of this, however,
most of his time, as will soon be seen, was spent, not in
Georgia, but in itinerating in the other English settlements.
This was exceedingly irregular; but, looking at results, who
will say that it was wrong? When he arrived at Philadelphia,
he did not intend it; but, unquestionably, his Master
did. The churches in the English colonies needed a religious
impulse quite as much as the churches of the mother-country.
Under God, the young evangelist and his fellows had moved
and agitated England; and now he was employed, by a
Providence which cannot err, and greatly to his own surprise,
in moving and agitating America. Let us follow him.</p>

<p>After riding, during the day, sixty miles, through woods
and forests and partially cultivated lands, he arrived at Philadelphia,
at eleven o'clock at night, on Friday, November 2,
1739. Where he slept, we are not informed; perhaps,
nowhere; for most likely, at such an hour, the sober-minded
Philadelphians had all retired to rest. Next morning, he
"went on board the <em>Elizabeth</em> to see his family;" he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
visited the officials of the town; he held Christian communion
"with some gracious souls;" and he "hired a
house at a very cheap rate, and was quite settled in it before
night."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sunday, Nov. 4. He "read prayers and assisted at the communion
in the morning; dined with one of the churchwardens, and preached
to a large congregation in the afternoon; went in the evening to a Quakers'
meeting, and heartily wished they would talk of an outward as well as
inward Christ."</p>

<p>Monday, Nov. 5. He "read prayers and preached to a large auditory;
dined with the other churchwarden; was visited in the afternoon by the
Presbyterian minister; went afterwards to see the Baptist minister; and
spent part of the evening most agreeably with two loving Quakers."</p>

<p>Tuesday, Nov. 6. He "read prayers and preached; went to the funeral
of a Quaker's child, and, as none of the Quakers spoke, he gave a word of
exhortation; was visited in the evening by the Presbyterian and Baptist
ministers; and admitted some women to prayers with his family."</p>

<p>Wednesday, Nov. 7. He "read prayers and preached in the church;
and gave a word of exhortation to more than a room full of people at his
own hired house."</p>

<p>Thursday, Nov. 8. He "read prayers and preached to a more numerous
congregation than he had seen yet; dined with an honest, open-hearted,
true Israelitish Quaker; and preached, in the evening, from the
Court-house stairs, to about six thousand people."</p>

<p>Friday, Nov. 9. He "read prayers and preached as usual in the
morning; was visited in a kind manner by the minister of the parish;
and preached again at six in the evening, from the Court-house stairs, to,
he believed, nearly eight thousand hearers. Even in London, he never
observed a more profound silence. The night was clear, but not cold;
and lights were in most of the windows round about."</p>

<p>Saturday, Nov. 10. "About eleven, he read prayers and preached in
the church; then dined with the minister of the parish; at his return
home, was much comforted by the coming of Mr. Tennent, an old grey-headed
disciple and soldier of Jesus Christ; about three, went to the
prison, and preached on the trembling jailor; returned home with the
Swedish minister and Mr. Tennent; conversed with them of the things of
God; and, in the evening, preached, to as large a congregation as there
was the night before, from the Court-house stairs." He adds: "I continued
my discourse above an hour, and, when I had finished, the people
seemed so unwilling to go, that I began to pray afresh, and I hope the
Lord sent them home not without a blessing. After preaching, my house
was filled with people who came to join in psalms and family prayer.
Many wept most bitterly whilst I was praying. Their hearts seemed to
be loaded with a sense of sin, the only preparative for the visitation of
Jesus Christ. Blessed be the Lord for sending me hither! Lord, give
me humility, and make me truly thankful! Amen, Lord Jesus!"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus did Whitefield begin his memorable ministry in
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Mr. Tennent has just been mentioned, and, as he and his
family will hereafter be often introduced to the reader's
notice, a brief account of him and them seems requisite.</p>

<p>The Rev. William Tennent, senior, was from Ireland, and
was an ordained minister of the Established Church of that
country. He was chaplain to an Irish nobleman; but, being
conscientiously scrupulous about conforming to the terms
imposed on the clergy, he was deprived of his living; and, in
1718, migrated to Pennsylvania, with his wife, four sons, and
a daughter.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> He applied to be received as a member of the
Presbyterian Synod of Philadelphia. That body required
him to state in writing the reasons of his dissent from the
Episcopal communion. One of the most prominent of his
reasons was, that the Church of Ireland connived "at
Arminian doctrines." His case was considered; his credentials
were satisfactory; he was admitted a member of
the Synod, and settled at Neshaminy, twenty miles north
of Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> There, about the year 1720, he erected a
school, long known as the "Log College," where some of the
most distinguished ministers of that period received their
education. Among these were his four sons, and Messrs.
Rowland, Campbell, Lawrence, Beatty, Robinson, and
Samuel Blair. He died in 1743. He is described as "a
man of great integrity, simplicity, industry, and piety;" and
to him the American churches were much indebted.</p>

<p>Charles Tennent, one of the four sons, was minister of the
Presbyterian Church at Whiteclay Creek.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>John was licensed by the Newcastle Presbytery, and was
settled at Freehold, New Jersey, where his labours were
greatly blessed. His chapel was usually crowded; religion
became the general subject of discourse; the terror of God
fell on the inhabitants of the place; and many were converted.
John Tennent's ministry was of short duration.
He was called to the Freehold congregation in 1730, and
died in 1732.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>
<p>He was succeeded by his brother William, in 1733. The
religious excitement, commenced under the ministry of John,
continued, less or more, for about a dozen years. Mr.
William Tennent writes: "Those who were brought to the
Saviour were all prepared for it by a sharp law-work of conviction,
discovering to them their sinfulness both by nature
and practice, as well as their liableness to damnation for
their original and actual transgressions. They all confessed
the justice of God in their eternal perdition; and thus were
shut up to the blessed necessity of seeking relief by faith in
Christ alone."<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> For forty-four years, Mr. Tennent officiated as
pastor of the church at Freehold. He died on the 8th of
March, 1777.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> The old house at Freehold, in which John
and William Tennent used to preach, is still standing in its
primitive simplicity. The building is forty feet by sixty,
and, beneath its middle aisle, are deposited the remains
of William Tennent. In one of the walls is a handsome
monumental tablet, recording the chief dates of his earthly
pilgrimage.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>Gilbert Tennent became a licentiate of the Newcastle
Presbytery in 1725, and, in 1726, was ordained minister of
New Brunswick, in New Jersey. "For eighteen months
after his settlement at New Brunswick, Mr. Tennent saw no
evidence that any one had been savingly benefited by his
labours. He then commenced a serious examination of the
members of his church, as to the grounds of their hope, which
he found, in many cases, to be but sand. Such he solemnly
warned, and urged to seek converting grace. He preached
much, at this time, upon original sin, repentance, the nature
and necessity of conversion, and endeavoured to alarm the
secure by the terrors of the Lord. These efforts were followed
by the conviction and conversion of a considerable number of
persons."<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Gilbert Tennent became prominent in his endeavours
to reform abuses in the Presbyterian churches, and not
infrequently was in conflict with his brethren. As early as
1735, he succeeded in persuading the synod to pass a resolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
that due care should be taken to examine candidates
both for the ministry and for the Lord's supper, respecting
the evidences of the grace of God in them, as well as their
other necessary qualifications. In 1740, he read a paper to
the New Brunswick Synod, complaining that the preaching
of a number of its members was "powerless and unsavoury,"
"too general," "soft and flattering," and, therefore, "unsuccessful."
He also, in the same year, preached and published
his famous sermon on the danger of an unconverted ministry,
which led to a Presbyterian schism. He described the generality
of the ministers of that generation as "letter-learned Pharisees,
plastered hypocrites, having the form of godliness, but
destitute of its power." He told the people that the reason
why they had seen so few cases of conviction or conversion
among them was because "the bulk of their spiritual guides
were stone blind and stone dead."<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>In 1740, Whitefield persuaded him to act as his successor
in Boston, and in the Province of New England generally.
Tennent consented, and away he went to his new sphere of
labour, with almost rustic simplicity; wearing his hair undressed,
and a large great-coat girt with a leathern girdle.
His ministry in New Jersey had been greatly blessed; and
now, in New England, it was hardly less successful than
Whitefield's had been. He seemed "to shake the country,
as with an earthquake. Wherever he came, hypocrisy and
Pharisaism either fell before him, or gnashed their teeth
against him. Cold orthodoxy also started from her downy
cushion to imitate or to denounce him; for, like Elijah on
Carmel, he made neutrality impossible." In 1743, he established
a new church in Philadelphia, consisting of Whitefield's
followers, and closed his laborious and eminently
successful ministry in the year 1765.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> For more than forty
years, he had enjoyed an unshaken assurance of his interest
in redeeming love. As a preacher, he had but few equals.
His publications were more than a score in number. At his
death, he was succeeded in the congregation at Philadelphia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
by the Rev. James Sproat, who had been converted by his
ministry.</p>

<p>These are very imperfect notices of the Tennents; but
they will help the reader to understand ensuing extracts from
Whitefield's Journals and correspondence.</p>

<p>On Monday, Nov. 12, Whitefield left Philadelphia for the
purpose of visiting New York. Four horses were lent to
him and to his friends. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"About one, we got safe to Burlington, in the Jerseys, twenty miles from
Philadelphia. Immediately after dinner, I read prayers and preached in
the church, to a mixed but thronged and attentive congregation. About
eight in the evening, we reached Trent, another town in the Jerseys, and
went to rest in peace and joy.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, Nov. 13. Left Trent at six in the morning, and reached
Brunswick, thirty miles distant, at one. Here we were much refreshed
with the company of Mr. Gilbert Tennent, an eminent Dissenting minister,
about forty years of age, son of that good old man who came to see me on
Saturday at Philadelphia. God, I find, has been pleased greatly to own
his labours. He and his associates are now the burning and shining lights
of this part of America. Several pious souls came to see me at his house,
with whom I took sweet counsel. At their request, I read the Church
Liturgy and preached in Mr. Tennent's meeting-house; for there is no
place set apart for the worship of the Church of England. I was above
an hour in my sermon, and I trust I shall hear it was not preached in
vain.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, Nov. 14. Set out from Brunswick, in company with Mr.
Tennent and my other fellow-travellers; and, as we passed along, we spent
our time most agreeably in telling one another what God had done for our
souls. About four, we reached New York, where we were most affectionately
received by the family of Mr. Noble.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> I waited upon Mr. V&mdash;&mdash;y,
the commissary, but he was not at home. Then I went to the meeting-house
to hear Mr. Gilbert Tennent preach, and never before heard such
a searching sermon. He convinced me more and more that we can preach
the gospel of Christ no further than we have experienced the power of it
in our own hearts. Being deeply convicted of sin, by God's Holy Spirit,
at his first conversion, Mr. Tennent has learned experimentally to dissect
the heart of the natural man. Hypocrites must either soon be converted
or enraged at his preaching. He is a son of thunder, and does not fear
the faces of men. After sermon, we spent the evening together at Mr.
Noble's house. My soul was humbled and melted down with a sense of
God's mercies, and I found more and more what a babe and novice I was
in the things of God.</p>

<p>"Thursday, Nov. 15. Waited upon Mr. V&mdash;&mdash;; but he seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
full of anger and resentment, and, before I asked him for the use of his
pulpit, denied it. He said, they did not want my assistance. I replied, if
they preached the gospel, I wished them good luck in the name of the
Lord; but, as he had denied me the church without my asking the use of
it, I would preach in the fields, for all places were alike to me. I, therefore,
preached in the fields, to upwards of two thousand, at three in the
afternoon; and expounded, at six in the evening, to a very thronged and
attentive audience, in the reverend and worthy Mr. Pemberton's<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> meeting-house.
In the field, a few mocked, but, after speaking to them, they grew
more serious. At night, the people seemed exceedingly attentive, and I
have not felt greater freedom in preaching, and more power in prayer, for
a long while.</p>

<p>"Saturday, Nov. 17. Preached, in the afternoon, at the meeting-house,
to a full congregation; and again at night, to a great multitude standing
round the doors.</p>

<p>"Sunday, Nov. 18. Preached, this morning at eight o'clock, to a very
attentive auditory. Went to the English Church, both morning and
evening. At night, a great multitude flocked to hear the word. Some
petitioned to have the use of the Town Hall, but it was denied. I thought
of expounding out of a window, and to let the people stand in the street;
but, at last, with much difficulty, I got into the meeting-house, and, the
people being prevailed on to open the windows, numbers could hear, who
stood outside. About ten o'clock, I took boat, with my friends, and had a
pleasant passage to a place about half-way to Elizabeth Town, where we
lay down with joy, and thankfulness for the great goodness the Lord had
shewn us."</p></blockquote>

<p>One who was present at these services in New York,
wrote as follows, in Prince's "Christian History":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I never saw, in my life, such attentive audiences as Mr. Whitefield's in
New York. All he said was demonstration, life, and power. The people's
eyes and ears hung upon his lips. They greedily devoured every word.
He preached, during four days, twice every day. He is a man of middle
stature, of a slender body, of a fair complexion, and of a comely appearance.
He is of a sprightly, cheerful temper, and acts and moves with
great agility and life. The endowments of his mind are uncommon; his
wit is quick and piercing; his imagination lively and florid; and, as far
as I can discern, both are under the direction of a solid judgment. He
has a most ready memory, and, I think, speaks entirely without notes.
He has a clear and musical voice, and a wonderful command of it. He
uses much gesture, but with great propriety. Every accent of his voice,
every motion of his body <em>speaks</em>; and both are natural and unaffected.
If his delivery be the product of art, it is certainly the perfection of it, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
it is entirely concealed. He has a great mastery of words, but studies
much plainness of speech. He spends not his zeal in trifles. He breathes
a most catholic spirit; and professes that his whole design is to bring men
to Christ; and that, if he can obtain this end, his converts may go to what
church, and worship God in what form, they like best."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was the commencement of Whitefield's ministry
in New York. His own Church would not admit him;
and, therefore, he began to preach in Dissenting chapels.
This was not pre-designed. Whitefield was a child of
Providence; and when that seemed to point out his path,
he felt no hesitancy, but, utterly regardless of the frowns
and flatteries of men, he did what he deemed to be his duty.
There was no dogged obstinacy about him. Perhaps one of
his failings was that he was too persuadable; but even such
a failing (if such existed) always leaned to the side of
virtue. Writing, whilst at New York, to the Rev. Benjamin
Colman, D.D., of Boston, who had mentioned him in a letter
to Mr. Pemberton, he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I love to be acquainted with old servants of Jesus Christ. I delight
to sit at their feet and receive instruction from them. You said right,
reverend sir, when you said 'I was but a young divine.' Indeed, I am a
novice in the things of God. I can only say that I desire to know the
whole will of God, that I may communicate it to others. Reverend sir,
into what a lethargy is the Christian world fallen! Foolish and wise
virgins are all slumbering and sleeping. It is high time for all who love
the Lord Jesus to lift up their voices like trumpets, and to give warning of
the Bridegroom's coming. Many, I hope, are already alarmed.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> Philadelphia
people receive the gospel gladly. Here [at New York] there has
been a little opposition, and, therefore, I hope success will be given to the
word. Oh, reverend sir, entreat the Lord that I may be kept humble, and
dependent upon our dear Lord Jesus. Shortly I expect to suffer for Him.
May I not deny Him in that hour!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Writing to his mother, Whitefield says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <em>November 16, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Honoured Mother</span>,&mdash;New friends are raised up every day, whithersoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
we go. The people of Philadelphia have used me most courteously,
and many, I believe, have been pricked to the heart.... Oh, my
honoured mother, my soul is in distress for you. Flee, flee, I beseech you,
to Jesus Christ, by faith. Lay hold on Him, and do not let Him go.
God has given you convictions. Arise, arise, and never rest till they end
in sound conversion. Dare to deny yourself. My honoured mother, I
beseech you, by the mercies of God in Christ Jesus, dare to take up your
cross, and follow Christ."</p></blockquote>

<p>These are beautiful exhibitions of humbleness, simplicity,
earnestness, and love. Let us follow Whitefield in his return
to Philadelphia.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Monday, Nov. 19, Took boat about five in the morning, and reached
Elizabeth Town at seven. Dined with Mr. Dickinson,<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> a worthy Dissenting
minister, who had sent a letter of invitation to New York, and offered
me the use of his meeting-house. About twelve, I preached in it, according
to appointment, to upwards of seven hundred people. God was pleased
to open my mouth against both ministers and people, among all denominations,
who imprison the truth in unrighteousness.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, Nov. 20. Reached New Brunswick about six last night;
and preached to-day, at noon, for near two hours, in Mr. Tennent's
meeting-house, to a large assembly gathered together from all parts.
About three in the afternoon, I preached again; and, at seven, I baptized
two children, and preached a third time. Among others who came to
hear the word, were several ministers, whom the Lord has been pleased
to honour, in making them instruments of bringing many sons to glory.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>"Wednesday, Nov. 21. Set out early, with about a score in company,
for Maidenhead, a little more than twenty miles from New Brunswick,
where, at Mr. Tennent's request, I had appointed to preach to-day. At
noon, I preached from a waggon to about fifteen hundred persons. Here
one Mr. Rowland,<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> another faithful minister of Jesus Christ, gave us the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
meeting. He has been a preacher about two years, has gone about
doing good, and has had many seals to his ministry. Much of the simplicity
of Christ was discernible in his behaviour. After sermon, in
company with above thirty horse, I went to Trent Town, ten miles from
Maidenhead, and preached, in the Court House, in the evening.</p>

<p>"Thursday, Nov. 22. Set out for Neshaminy (twenty miles from
Trent Town), where old Mr. Tennent lives, and keeps an academy, and
where I was to preach to-day, according to appointment. We came
thither about twelve, and found above three thousand people gathered
together in the meeting-house yard, and Mr. William Tennent preaching
to them, because we were beyond the appointed time. When I came up,
he stopped, and sung a psalm, and then I began to speak. At first, the
people seemed unaffected, but, in the midst of my discourse, the hearers
began to be melted down, and cried much. After I had finished, Mr.
Gilbert Tennent gave a word of exhortation. At the end of his discourse,
we sung a psalm, and then dismissed the people with a blessing. After
our exercises were over, we went to old Mr. Tennent, who entertained us
like one of the ancient patriarchs. His wife seemed to me like Elizabeth,
and he like Zacharias; both, as far as I can find, walk in all the ordinances
and commandments of the Lord blameless. We had sweet communion
with each other, and spent the evening in concerting measures for promoting
our Lord's kingdom. It happens very providentially that Mr.
Tennent and his brethren are appointed to be a presbytery by the synod,
so that they intend breeding up gracious youths, and sending them out into
our Lord's vineyard. The place wherein the young men study now is, in
contempt, called <em>the College</em>. It is a log-house, about twenty feet long,
and nearly as many broad; and, to me, it seemed to resemble the school
of the old prophets. From this despised place, seven or eight worthy
ministers of Jesus have lately been sent forth; more are almost ready to
be sent; and a foundation is now laying for the instruction of many others.
The devil will certainly rage against them; but the work, I am persuaded,
is of God, and will not come to nought. Carnal ministers oppose them
strongly; and, because people, when awakened by Mr. Tennent or his
brethren, see through them, and therefore leave their ministry, the poor
gentlemen are loaded with contempt, and looked upon as persons who
turn the world upside-down.</p>

<p>"Friday, Nov. 23. Parted with dear Mr. Tennent and his worthy
fellow-labourers; but promised to remember each other <em>publicly</em> in our
prayers. Rode to Abingdon, about ten miles from Neshaminy, and
preached to above two thousand people from a porch-window belonging
to the meeting-house. It is surprising how such bodies of people, so
scattered abroad, can be gathered at so short a warning. At Neshaminy, I
believe, there were nearly a thousand horses. The people, however, did not
sit upon them to hear the sermon, as in England, but tied them to the hedges;
and thereby much disorder was prevented. Though it was cold, the congregation
stood very patiently in the open air, and seemed in no hurry to
return home after the discourses were ended. As soon as I had finished
at Abingdon, I hastened to Philadelphia, where I found my family in good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
order, and all things carried on according to my desire. Oh, how can I
express my thankfulness for this little excursion!"</p></blockquote>

<p>This was a new kind of life to Whitefield. In England,
he had preached, when he was permitted, in churches, and
when not permitted, in Moorfields and places similar. Here
he was preaching in Presbyterian, or, as he regarded them,
Dissenting meeting-houses, or in open spaces surrounded by
the grand old forests, through which he and his companions
joyously pursued their sylvan journeys. Professedly,
he was a Church of England clergyman, but practically a
Dissenting minister. Of course, his action was ecclesiastically
irregular, but it occasioned him no anxiety or uneasiness.
He was preaching the gospel, and that to him was quite
enough. When he got back to Philadelphia, he wrote quite
a batch of letters, all bearing the same date, November 28;
but extracts from two only must suffice.</p>

<p>To the Rev. Ebenezer Pemberton, he says, perhaps with
more lowliness than was decorous:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have been much concerned since I saw you, lest I behaved not with
that humility toward you, which is due from a babe to a father in Christ;
but you know, reverend sir, how difficult it is to meet with success, and
not be puffed up with it. If any such thing was discernible in my conduct,
oh pity me, and pray to the Lord to heal my pride. Alas! who can
hope to be justified by his works? My preaching, praying, etc., are only
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">splendida peccata</i>. The blood of Christ, applied to my soul by a living
faith, is the only thing that can render them acceptable."</p></blockquote>

<p>He was not only in close communion with the Presbyterians
of America, but he wrote as follows to the Rev.
Ralph Erskine, the Presbyterian Reformer, in Scotland:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I bless the Lord, from my soul, for raising you and several other
burning and shining lights to appear for Him in this midnight of the
Church. My heart has been much warmed by reading some of your
sermons, especially that preached before the Associate Presbytery. I long
more and more to hear of the rise and progress of your proceedings,
and how far you would willingly carry the reformation of the Church of
Scotland. My ignorance of the constitution of the Scotch Church is the
cause of my writing after this manner. I should be obliged to you, if you
would recommend to me some useful books, especially such as open the
holy sacrament. I like Boston's 'Fourfold State of Man' exceedingly.
Under God, it has been of much service to my soul. I believe I agree
with you and him in the essential truths of Christianity. I bless God, His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Spirit has convinced me of our eternal election by the Father through the
Son; of our free justification through faith in His blood; of our sanctification
as the consequence of that; and of our final perseverance and
glorification as the result of all. These, I am persuaded, God has joined
together; these neither men nor devils shall ever be able to put asunder.
My only scruple at present is, 'whether you approve of taking the sword
in defence of your religious rights?' One of our English bishops, when I
was with him, called you <em>Cameronians</em>. They, I think, took up arms,
which I think to be contrary to the Spirit of Jesus Christ and His
apostles. Some few passages in your sermon before the Presbytery, I
thought, were a little suspicious of favouring that principle. I pray God
your next may inform me that I am mistaken; for when zeal carries
us to such a length, I think it ceases to be zeal according to knowledge.
Dearest sir, be not angry at my writing thus freely. I wish you good
luck in all your pious undertakings. I pray God to prosper the work of
your hands, and to make you a noble instrument in bringing many sons
to glory."</p></blockquote>

<p>There can be no question that Whitefield's intercourse
with the Presbyterians of America powerfully affected him.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
This was not surprising; for, apart from the fact that the
clergy of his own Church generally disdained him, these
Presbyterian ministers were men of kindred spirits to his
own, intensely earnest, and blessed with the highest enjoyments
of religion. The following letter addressed to Whitefield
will shew "what manner of men they were." As will
be seen, it was written immediately after Whitefield's first
visit to New York.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">New Brunswick</span>, <em>December 1, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Very Reverend and dear Brother</span>,&mdash;I think I never found
such a strong and passionate affection to any stranger as to you, when I
saw your courage and labour for God at New York. I found a willingness
in my heart to die with you, or to die for you. The reason why I
spoke so little, for the most part of the time while I was with you, was a
shameful sense I had of my ignorance and barrenness, after such a
multitude of waterings and sealings as God had given me. Though I am
as a brute beast before God, one of the meanest and vilest worms that
ever crawled on the creation of God, yet I must say, to His praise, and my
own shame, that I have had, in time past, such discoveries of my great
Father's dear affection as have overcome me. For months together, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
soul has been so ravished with divine objects, that my animal spirits have
been wasted, and my sleep much broken. I have been made to loathe
my food, because of the superior sweetness I have found in Christ. I
could not refrain my soul from a secret longing for reproach, poverty,
imprisonment, and death, for a glorious Christ, that, thereby, I might
testify a grateful regard to His unspeakably dear and venerable majesty.
I could not refrain wishing that every hair of my head was a life, that I
might lay it down freely for my Lord Jesus. The fear of bringing any
reproach on His religion has many times brought bitter tears from my
eyes and heart. Sometimes, when travelling on the road, when I beheld
the canopy of heaven, my heart has been suddenly ravished with love to
God as my Father; so that I could not forbear crying out, in the pleasing
transports of a childlike affection, 'Father! Father!' with a full and
sweet assurance that He was my Father, and my God. In the night
season, when I awoke, my soul was still with God. The passion of my
soul for Christ was so vehement, that my dreams were full of Him. Thus
it was for a long tract of time, But, alas! when the great God wisely
withdrew His quickening presence, and let Satan loose upon me, O what
terrible havoc did he make in my soul! and that, alas! too much with my
will. I thought myself a monster in iniquity, and that there was some
peculiar brutishness in my heart, that none had but myself. This made
me often wish for death to get clear of it. This has often enraged my soul
so against sin and myself for it, that I have thought, if it were lawful, I
could freely try to pluck my heart out, and tear it in pieces.</p>

<p>"Since you were here, I have been among my people, dealing with
them plainly about their souls, in their houses; examining them one by
one as to their experiences; telling natural people the danger of their
state; exhorting them that were totally secure, to seek convictions, and
those that were convinced, to seek Jesus; and reproving pious people
for their faults. Blessed be God! I have seen hopeful appearances of
concern.</p>

<p class="sig">

</p></blockquote>

<p>To return to Whitefield. In New York, he was not
allowed to preach in the Church of England; but his
preaching in the Presbyterian meeting-house received the
sanction of his Divine Master. A few days after his departure,
the Rev. Ebenezer Pemberton wrote to him as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You left New York under a deep and
universal concern. Many were greatly affected, and I hope abiding impressions
are left upon some. Some, who were before very loose and
profligate, look back with shame upon their past lives and conversation,
and seem resolved upon a thorough reformation. I mention these things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
to strengthen you in the blessed cause you are engaged in, and to support
you in your abundant labours. When I heard so many were concerned for
their eternal welfare, I appointed a lecture on Wednesday evening, though
it was not the usual season; and, though the warning was short, we had
a numerous and attentive audience. In short, I cannot but hope that
your coming among us has been the means of awakening some to a serious
sense of practical religion, and may be the beginning of a good work in
this sinful place. I pray God to take you under His gracious protection,
to sustain you under your many trials, and make you gloriously successful
in converting sinners from the error of their ways. My wife joins me in
affectionate regards to you, Mr. Seward, and your other friends, whom we
love in sincerity.</p>

<p class="sig">
"I am, your affectionate brother and very humble servant,<br />
"<span class="smcap">E. Pemberton</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield returned to Philadelphia on Friday, November
23. On Saturday, November 24, he preached, morning
and afternoon, to "a vast concourse of all denominations,"
in the English Episcopal Church. The next day, a scene
occurred within the consecrated building. Whitefield
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sunday, Nov. 25. Was somewhat alarmed this morning by one,<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
who, after my sermon, told the congregation in the church, with a loud
voice, 'That there was no such term as <em>imputed righteousness</em> in Holy
Scripture; that such a doctrine put a stop to all goodness; and that we
were to be judged for our good works and obedience, and were commanded
<em>to do and live</em>.' When he had ended, I denied his first proposition,
and brought a text to prove that 'imputed righteousness' was a
scriptural expression; but, thinking the church an improper place for
disputation, I said no more at that time. In the afternoon, however, I
discoursed upon the words, 'The Lord our righteousness,' and shewed
how the Lord Jesus was to be <em>our whole righteousness</em>. I proved how
the contrary doctrine overthrew all divine revelation, and endeavoured to
answer objections. I produced the Articles of our Church, and concluded
with an exhortation to lay aside reasoning infidelity, and to submit to
Jesus Christ, who is the end of the law for <em>righteousness</em>, to every one
that believeth. The church was thronged within and without; all were
wonderfully attentive; and many, as I was informed, were convinced
that the Lord Christ was <em>our righteousness</em>.</p>

<p>"Monday, Nov. 26. Read prayers and preached twice in the church,
to very large and attentive congregations. The word came with great
power; and people now apply to me so fast for advice under convictions,
and so continually crowd in upon me, that I have not time to write to my
English friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tuesday, Nov. 27. According to appointment, I preached at German
Town,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> seven miles from Philadelphia, from a balcony, to above six
thousand people. I spoke nearly two hours. Great numbers continued
weeping for a considerable time. A German most kindly entertained me.
I think there are not less than fifteen denominations of Christians in
German Town, and yet all agree in one thing, that is, to hold Jesus
Christ as their head, and to worship Him in spirit and in truth. The
Germans are about to translate my Journals into High Dutch. About
eight in the evening we reached Philadelphia.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, Nov. 28. Read prayers and preached, as usual, to a
thronged congregation. Heard of more who were under convictions. In
the morning, notice had been given that I would preach my farewell
sermon in the afternoon. But the church, (though as large as most of our
London churches,) being not large enough to contain a fourth part of the
people, we adjourned to the fields, and I preached for an hour and a half
from a balcony, to upwards of ten thousand hearers, very attentive and
much affected.</p>

<p>"Blessed be God for such success at New York and Philadelphia. One
of the printers has told me he has taken above two hundred subscriptions
for printing my Sermons and Journals. Numbers of letters have been
sent me from persons under convictions. As I have sown spiritual things,
the people were willing I should reap carnal things. They have, therefore,
sent me butter, sugar, chocolate, pickles, cheese, and flour, for my
poor orphans.</p>

<p>"Thursday, Nov. 29. Had the satisfaction of settling all my family
affairs, and gave orders for my family to set sail immediately after my
leaving Philadelphia. From seven in the morning, the people thronged
round the door, and, when we parted, oh, how bitterly did they weep!
Nearly twenty gentlemen accompanied me on horseback out of the town.
About seven miles off, another company was waiting to meet us, so that,
at last, we were nearly two hundred horse. By three, we reached
Chester, and I preached to about five thousand people from a balcony. It
being court-day, the justices sent word they would defer their meeting till
mine was over; and the minister of the parish, because the church would
not contain the people, provided the place from which I spoke. I was told
that near a thousand of the congregation came from Philadelphia."</p></blockquote>

<p>For the present, Whitefield had left Pennsylvania, and
was on his way, through Maryland, Virginia, and Carolina,
to Georgia. Before attending him, the following must be
added respecting his first visit to Philadelphia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>A <em>printer</em> has just been mentioned. There can be no
doubt that this was the celebrated Benjamin Franklin.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> This
remarkable man was now in the thirty-third year of his age.
Some nineteen years before, he had entered Philadelphia,
hungry, tired, and dirty; his pockets filled with shirts and
stockings, and the whole of his worldly wealth consisting of
a Dutch dollar. He was now an industrious printer; for
several years had published "Poor Richard's Almanack;"
had filled the office of clerk to the General Assembly; and
had recently been appointed postmaster. He was also an
alderman and a magistrate, but took no part in the business
of the bench, commonly employing himself while sitting there
"in contriving magic squares and circles." Of his subsequent
career, and of the high honours conferred upon him, it is not
necessary here to speak.</p>

<p>Of course, Whitefield attracted the attention of Franklin.
The latter writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In 1739, the Rev. Mr. Whitefield arrived among us. He was, at
first, permitted to preach in some of our churches; but the clergy, taking
a dislike to him, soon refused him<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> their pulpits, and he was obliged to
preach in the fields. The multitudes, of all sects and denominations,
that attended his sermons, were enormous, and it was a matter of speculation
to me (who was one of the number) to observe the extraordinary
influence of his oratory on his hearers, and how much they admired and
respected him, notwithstanding his common abuse of them, by assuring
them they were naturally <em>half beasts and half devils</em>. It was wonderful
to see the change soon made in the manners of our inhabitants. From
being thoughtless and indifferent about religion, it seemed as if all the
world were growing religious, so that one could not walk through Philadelphia
in the evening without hearing psalms sung in different families
of every street.</p>

<p>"Mr. Whitefield, on leaving us, went preaching all the way through the
colonies to Georgia. The settlement of that province had lately been
begun; but, instead of its being made with hardy, industrious husbandmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
accustomed to labour, the only people fitted for such an enterprise, it
consisted of families of broken shopkeepers, and other insolvent debtors,
and many of indolent habits, taken out of the jails, who, being set down
in the woods, unqualified for clearing land, and unable to endure the hardness
of a new settlement, perished in numbers, leaving many helpless
children unprovided for. The sight of these inspired Mr. Whitefield with
the idea of building an Orphan House there, in which they might be
supported and educated."<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So much from America's great printer, electrician, statesman,
and diplomatist, Benjamin Franklin. The reader is
now invited to accompany Whitefield through the three
colonies of Maryland, Virginia, and Carolina. Whitefield
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Friday, November 30. Preached at noon, and again at three in the
afternoon, at Wilmington. Spent the evening in sweet conversation with
Mr. William Tennent, brother to Mr. Gilbert Tennent, a faithful minister
of Jesus Christ, and with several Germans, whose hearts God has been
pleased to knit to me in a close and intimate union.</p>

<p>"Saturday, December 1. Reached Newcastle by ten in the morning,
and preached to about two thousand people from a balcony. Preached,
at four o'clock, at Christian Bridge, to about the same number as at Newcastle.
Near two hundred horse came on the road with us.</p>

<p>"Sunday, December 2. Returned last night to Newcastle, that I might
see my dear family, who came thither in the sloop just after I had left.
This morning, went on board, prayed, sung psalms, gave a word of
exhortation, and rejoiced much to see all things in such excellent order.
My dear friend, Captain Gladman, told me how kind the people of Philadelphia
had been to my family after my departure. One brought them
butter, another beer, etc., and the collector would not take his perquisite
for clearing the sloop. About ten, we came to Christian Bridge again,
and by twelve reached Whiteclay Creek, the place appointed for my preaching.
The weather was rainy, but upwards of ten thousand people were
assembled. There were several hundreds of horses. I preached from a
tent, erected for me by order of Mr. William Tennent, whose meeting-house
was near the place. I continued in my first discourse an hour and
a half, after which we went into a log-house, took a morsel of bread, and
warmed ourselves. I preached a second time from the same place. God
caused His power to be known in the congregation. Many souls were
melted down.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>"Monday, December 3. Came to North East in Maryland, where I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
had appointed to preach to-day. Little notice having been given, there
were not above fifteen hundred people; but God was with us, and many
were deeply affected. Immediately after sermon, we passed over Susquehannah
ferry, about a mile broad, and were received at a gentleman's
house. The gentleman told us he had been a little melancholy, and had
sent for some friends to help him to drive it away. I found the bottle
and the bowl were the means to be employed; but, blessed be God, the
design was, in a good measure, prevented by our coming. All joined in
family prayer; and I went to bed pitying the miserable condition of those
who live a life of luxury and self-indulgence. They are afraid to look
into themselves; and, if their consciences are at any time awakened,
they must be lulled asleep again by drinking and evil company.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, December 4. Baited at Joppa, a little town about fifteen
miles from the place where we lay. I gave a word of exhortation to about
forty people in the church.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, December 5. Lay last night at Newtown, fifteen miles
from Joppa; ate what was set before us; joined in family prayer; and,
as opportunity offered, put in a word for God. In the morning, we sung
and prayed. By four in the afternoon, we reached Annapolis, a little town,
but the metropolis of Maryland. The house where we lodged was very
commodious, but the people of it seemed to be surprised when they heard
us talk of God and Christ.</p>

<p>"Thursday, December 6. Waited on the governor, and was received
with much civility. Went to pay my respects to the minister of the
parish, who happened not to be within; but, whilst we were at dinner, he
came, and offered me his pulpit, his house, or anything he could supply
me with. About four, he came and introduced me and my friends to a
gentleman's house, where we had some useful conversation. Our conversation
ran chiefly on the new birth, and the folly and sinfulness of
those amusements, whereby the polite part of the world are so fatally
diverted from the pursuit of the one thing needful.</p>

<p>"Friday, December 7. Preached in the morning and evening to small
polite auditories. The governor came to the morning service, and, at
noon, I and my friends dined with him.</p>

<p>"Saturday, December 8. Came to Upper Marlborough, and wrote
letters to some under convictions at Philadelphia."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here let us pause. Besides his letters to penitents at
Philadelphia, Whitefield wrote the two following&mdash;the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
to the Rev. Ebenezer Pemberton, and the second to Mr.
Noble, his host at New York:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Upper Marlborough</span>, <em>December 8, 1739</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Rev. and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Till now, I have neither had leisure nor
freedom to answer your kind letter. Blessed be God, who has opened
the hearts of some of His people at New York to receive the word. May
He enable you to water what His own right hand hath planted! I wish
you good luck in the name of the Lord. I wish all His servants were
prophets. Oh that He would be pleased to send forth experimental
labourers into His harvest! I fear that, amongst you, as well as in other
places, there are many who are well versed in the doctrines of grace
(having learned them at the university); but, notwithstanding, are heart-hypocrites,
and enemies to the power of godliness. Dear sir, I use this
freedom, because I love simplicity. Pardon me, for out of the fulness
and sincerity of my heart, my pen writeth. Oh, entreat the God of all
grace to give me humility, so shall success not prove my ruin. Mr.
Noble's letter, and my next Journal, will acquaint you how the Lord Jesus
has been getting Himself the victory since I left New York. There has
been such little opposition, that I have been almost tempted to cry out,
'Satan, why sleepest thou?' Oh, dear sir, thank God on my behalf; for,
indeed, He deals most lovingly with, rev. sir, your most unworthy brother
and fellow-labourer,</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I cannot defer writing to dear Mr. Noble any longer.
This afternoon God brought us hither. Some are solicitous for my staying
here to-morrow. As it seems to be a call from Providence, I have
complied with their request. Oh that I may be enabled to lift up my
voice like a trumpet, and to speak with the demonstration of the Spirit
and with power! These parts are in a dead sleep. At Annapolis, I
preached twice, and spoke home to some ladies concerning the vanity
of their false politeness. But, alas; they are wedded to their quadrille
and ombre. The minister of the place was under convictions. He wept
twice, and earnestly begged my prayers. He will not frighten people, I
believe, with harsh doctrine. He loves to prophesy smooth things. God
blessed the word wonderfully at Philadelphia. I have great reason to
think many are brought home to God. Oh, help me, help me, dearest
Mr. Noble, help me to be thankful; and accept my thanks, though late,
for all favours received when at New York. Salute your dear wife, my
kind hostess. Exhort her to be severely kind to her little boy. I am
your weak, but affectionate friend, brother, and servant in Christ,</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania and the Jerseys, Whitefield had been in
the midst of a great revival. In Maryland, he felt himself
in a moral and religious desert. His Journal continues:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sunday, December 9. Preached at Upper Marlborough, to a small,
polite, and seemingly very curious audience. There being no sermon
in the afternoon, we took horse, and went a Sabbath-day's journey as far
as Piscataway, where I wrote some letters to our English friends.</p>

<p>"Monday, December 10. Reached Potomac by three in the afternoon.
Potomac is a river which parts the two provinces of Maryland
and Virginia. It is six miles broad. We attempted to go over it; but,
after we had rowed about a mile, the wind blew so violently, and night
was coming on so fast, that we were obliged to go back and lie in the
person's house who kept the ferry, where they brought out such things as
they had.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, December 11. Had a delightful passage over the river
this morning. Observed the country to be much more open, and the
roads better, than in Maryland. Passed over two more ferries in the
day's journey, and were put to some little inconvenience for want of
finding a public-house in the way. However, at last, we met a poor
woman, who was going to sell cakes to the trained bands, of which we
bought some; and, a few miles farther, a planter let us have some provender
for our beasts, and a little milk and small beer for ourselves. At
six at night, we got to a place called Seals Church, twenty-nine miles
from Potomac. Here we called at a person's house to whom we were
recommended; but the mistress of it was not at home, and the overseer
of the slaves, at first, was unwilling to receive us. However, finding we
were wet and strangers, he was at last prevailed upon to let us abide
there all night; and furnished us with a good fire, with some little meat,
and milk, and a cake baked on the hearth, which was exceedingly
refreshing, and afforded us no small matter for praise and thanksgiving.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, December 12. We came to Piscataway ferry, where
the man of the house spared us some corn and sheaves for our horses,
but had neither milk nor bread in the house for ourselves. However, I
endeavoured to feed him with spiritual bread; but he seriously asked one
of us if I was not a Quaker. At four in the afternoon, we reached an
ordinary, and were refreshed with what meat they had. In the evening,
some gentlemen came disordered in liquor; but the woman of the house
kept them from us, and we slept very comfortably on the bed that she
made us in the kitchen.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> I talked to her of religion, and told her that we
were to be born again. She said that was true, but it was to be done
<em>after death</em>.</p>

<p>"Thursday, December, 13. Set out just as the sun rose; got to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
ordinary by noon; ate what was set before us with some degree of thankfulness;
and reached the house of Colonel Whiting long before night.
Here God spread a plentiful table for us.</p>

<p>"Friday, December 14. Reached Williamsburg, the metropolis of
Virginia, by the evening.</p>

<p>"Saturday, December 15. Dined with the governor, who received me
most courteously. Paid my respects to the Rev. Mr. Blair, the Commissary
of Virginia. He received me with joy, and asked me to preach.
He has been chiefly instrumental in raising a beautiful college at Williamsburg,
in which is a foundation for about eight scholars, a president, two
masters, and professors in the several sciences. Here the gentlemen of
Virginia send their children. The present masters came from Oxford.
Two of them were my contemporaries there. I rejoiced in seeing such a
place in America.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>"Sunday, December 16. Preached in the morning. Several gentlemen
came from York, fourteen miles off. There being no sermon customarily
in the afternoon, I left Williamsburg, promising, if possible, to visit these
parts again in the summer.</p>

<p>"Monday, December 17. Got over a ferry three miles broad last night,
and met with a young man who shewed us the way to Captain R&mdash;&mdash;n's,
who entertained us with much generosity, and was so kind as to accompany
us fourteen miles this morning. We came to an ordinary about
thirty miles from the place where we lay last night. Here we met with
what some would call very indifferent entertainment. Bashfulness, and a
fear of being troublesome, have kept us from embracing offers of gentlemen's
houses; but we have heard a good report of the generosity of the
Virginia gentlemen. I find they are so willing, and accustomed to entertain
strangers, that few think it worth their while to keep public ordinaries.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, December 18. Being indisposed with fever, and one of our
horses being foundered, it was thought desirable to stay at the ordinary the
whole day.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, December 19. We took a short day's journey of about
twenty-six miles, and were most affectionately received by Colonel O&mdash;&mdash;n,
in North Carolina.</p>

<p>"Thursday, December 20. Took leave of our kind host, and travelled
cheerfully onwards. About noon, we alighted in the woods, to give our
horses provender, and to take a little refreshment ourselves, which we have
done every day this week, because there are no ordinaries in the way. By
four in the afternoon, we reached Eden Town, a little place, beautifully
situated by the water-side. Here we were well entertained at a public-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>"Friday, December 21. We went in a pettiagua over the sound, and
were nearly seven hours in our passage. It was about twelve miles over.
We met with a convenient ordinary on the other side.</p>

<p>"Saturday, December 22. We came to Bath-Town, a distance of nearly
fifty miles. It is by far the longest stage, and the roads are the worst we
have had, since we began our journey. The ground, most part of the way,
was swampy, and the country uninhabited. It was as hot as it is at
Midsummer in England; but we had a sweet breeze, which made our riding
through the woods exceeding pleasant. About midway, we met with an
ordinary, where we refreshed ourselves and beasts. We observed a variety
of birds; and, in the evening, heard wolves howling like a kennel of
hounds.</p>

<p>"Sunday, December 23. Sent to the minister of the place, and had
some conversation with him last night. Preached, at noon, to nearly a
hundred people, which, I found, was an extraordinary congregation, there
being seldom more than twenty at church.</p>

<p>"Monday, December 24. Crossed Pamplico river, about five miles
wide, yesterday morning. Lay at an ordinary at the water-side. Reached
Newborn Town, thirty miles from Bath Town, by six at night.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, December 25. Went to public worship, and received the
holy sacrament, which was celebrated in the Court House. In the afternoon,
the people were uncommonly attentive. One told me I had given
him a home stroke. The woman where we lodged would take nothing for
our Christmas dinner, and wished we could stay with them longer.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, December 26. Met with comfortable refreshment at an
ordinary on the road, and lodged at a little house in the woods, about
thirty-five miles from where we lay last night. I baptized two children. I
believe there may be hundreds of children in this province unbaptized, for
want of a minister.</p>

<p>"Thursday, December 27. Set out about eight in the morning, and
got to an ordinary, about thirty-three miles distant, before six at night. I
went, as my usual custom is, among the negroes belonging to the house.
One man was sick in bed, and two of his children said their prayers after
me very well.</p>

<p>"Friday, December 28. After about fifteen miles' ride, we comfortably
refreshed both ourselves and beasts at a poor widow's ordinary, who, a few
days ago, had buried her husband. After dinner, we had a pleasant ride
to New Town on Cape Fear River, nearly eighteen miles from the place
where we baited. We rejoiced greatly that the Lord had brought us so far
on our journey, and had not suffered us to go out of our way, through so
many almost uninhabited woods.</p>

<p>"Sunday, December 30. Wrote letters to my friends in England.
Read prayers, and preached, both morning and evening, in the Court
House. There being many of the Scotch amongst the congregation, who
lately came over to settle in North Carolina, I was led to make a particular
application to them, and to remind them of the necessity of living
holy lives, and giving proof of their zeal for those truths which they had
heard preached to them, with great purity and clearness, in their native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
country. About five in the evening, I and my friends passed the ferry,
and lay at the house of the High Sheriff of the county.</p>

<p>"Monday, December 31. Set out early, and met with more perils by
land than we have been exposed to yet. The swamps and creeks which
lay in the way were filled with water; and the bridges, being out of repair,
rendered travelling very dangerous. In one place, we were obliged to
swim our horses; in many, the waters were very high, and were not to
be passed without much difficulty. But we met with two good guides,
by whose assistance we were brought, at night, to a little house,
where with pleasure we reflected on the dangers and deliverances of the
day.</p>

<p>1740. Tuesday, January 1. About sunset, we came to a tavern, five
miles within the province of South Carolina. I believe the people of the
house, at first, wished I had not come to be their guest; for, it being New
Year's Day, several of the neighbours were met together to divert themselves
by dancing country dances. By the advice of my companions, I
went in amongst them. All were soon put to silence, and were, for some
time, so overawed, that, after I had discoursed with them on the nature of
baptism, and the necessity of being born again, in order to enjoy the
kingdom of heaven, I baptized, at their entreaty, one of their children, and
prayed as I was enabled, and as the circumstances of the company
required.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, January 2. Rose early, prayed, sung a hymn, gave
another word of exhortation to the dancers; and, at break of day, we
mounted our horses. For nearly twenty miles, we rode over a beautiful
bay, and were wonderfully delighted to see the porpoises taking their
pastime. We intended to call at a gentleman's house, about forty miles
distant from our last night's lodging, but we missed the way, and came to
a hut full of negroes. We enquired after the gentleman's house whither
we were directed; but the negroes said they knew no such man, and that
they were but new-comers. From these circumstances, we inferred that
they might be some of those who had lately made an insurrection in the
province, and had run away from their masters. We, therefore, thought
it best to mend our pace, and, soon after, we saw another nest of negroes
dancing round about a fire. When we had gone about a dozen miles, we
came to a plantation, the master of which gave us lodging, and our beasts
provender. During the day, we had ridden nearly three-score miles, and,
as we thought, in great peril of our lives.</p>

<p>"Thursday, January 3. Had a hospitable breakfast; set out late in
the morning; and, for the ease of our beasts, rode not above nineteen
miles the whole day. 'A good man,' says Solomon, 'is merciful to his
beast.'</p>

<p>"Friday, January 4. About eight in the evening, after riding forty-three
miles, we came to a tavern, five miles from Charleston.</p>

<p>"Saturday, January 5. Left our lodging before daylight, and, after we
had passed over a three-mile ferry, we reached Charleston about ten in
the morning.</p>

<p>"Sunday, January 6. Went to public service in the morning, but did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
not preach, because the curate had not a commission to lend the pulpit,
unless the commissary (then out of town) were present. Most of the town,
however, being eager to hear me, I preached, in the afternoon, in one of the
Dissenting meeting-houses, but was grieved to find so little concern in the
congregation. The auditory was large, but very polite. I question
whether the court-end of London could exceed them in affected finery,
gaiety of dress, and a deportment ill-becoming persons who have had
such Divine judgments lately sent amongst them. I reminded them of
this in my sermon; but I seemed to them as one that mocked.</p>

<p>"Monday, January 7. Finding the inhabitants desirous to hear me a
second time, I preached, in the morning, in the French church. The
audience was so great, that many stood without the door. I felt much
more freedom than I did yesterday. Many were melted into tears. One
of the town, most remarkably gay, was observed to weep. Instead of the
people going out (as they did yesterday) in a light, unthinking manner, a
visible concern was in most of their faces. After sermon, I and my friends
dined at a merchant's; and, as I was passing along, a letter was put into
my hands, wherein were these words: 'Remember me in your prayers,
for Christ's sake, who died for me a sinner.' Many of the inhabitants,
with full hearts, entreated me to give them one more sermon, and, though
I was just about to take the boat, I thought it my duty to comply with
their request. Notice was immediately given, and, in about half an hour,
a large congregation was assembled in the Dissenting meeting-house. In
the evening, I supped at another merchant's house, and had an opportunity,
for nearly two hours, to converse of the things of God with a large
company.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, January 8. Left our horses in Charleston, and set out for
Georgia, in an open canoe, having five negroes to row and steer us. The
poor slaves were very civil, and laborious. We lay one night on the water;
and, about five on Wednesday evening, arrived at Beaufort in Port Royal,
one hundred miles from Charleston.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, January 9. The wind being high, and sailing impracticable,
we stayed at Beaufort all the morning, and dined with kind Mr.
Jones, the minister of the place, who received us with great civility.
Afterwards, the weather being fair, and the tide serving, we again took
boat. In the night, we made a fire on the shore. A little after midnight,
we prayed with the negroes; took boat again; and reached Savannah the
next day, where I had a joyful meeting with my dear friends, who had
arrived three weeks ago."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, after a journey of five months' duration, Whitefield
once more reached his parish in America. If it be asked,
what induced him and his friends to leave their ship, at
Capen Lopen, on October 30th, and to spend ten weeks in
travelling to Georgia by land, through the four provinces of
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and Carolina? the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
and, indeed, the only answer is, we cannot tell. It seemed
a strange freak for Whitefield to send what he called his
"family" to Savannah by water, and for himself and William
Seward and others to travel to the same place, a distance
of at least six or seven hundred miles, through primeval
forests, uncultivated plains, and miasmal swamps. But even
out of this curious vagary came great results; for, in these
colonial wanderings, Whitefield became acquainted with the
Tennents and other Presbyterian ministers; and this affected
the whole of his future life.</p>

<p>When Whitefield sailed to America in 1739, he intended
to return to England in about a twelve-month. His
principal object was to erect and institute his Orphan House
in Georgia. As will be seen shortly, he did much more
than this; but his other labours were not included in his
first design. His own account of the commencement of
the Orphan House is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Some have thought that the erecting of such a building was only the
produce of my own brain; but they are much mistaken. It was first
proposed to me by my dear friend, the Rev. Mr. Charles Wesley, who,
with his Excellency General Oglethorpe, had concerted a scheme for
carrying on such a design before I had any thoughts of going abroad
myself. It was natural to think, that, as the government intended this
province for the refuge and support of many of our poor countrymen,
numbers of such adventurers must necessarily be taken off, by being
exposed to the hardships which unavoidably attend a new settlement. I
thought it, therefore, a noble design to erect a house for fatherless children,
and was resolved, in the strength of God, to prosecute it with all my
might. This was mentioned to the Honourable the Trustees. They took
it kindly at my hands; and, as I then began to be pretty popular at
Bristol and elsewhere, they wrote to the Bishop of Bath and Wells, asking
leave for me to preach a charity sermon on this occasion in the Abbey
Church. This was granted, and I, accordingly, began immediately to
compose a suitable discourse; but, knowing my first stay in Georgia
would be but short, on account of my returning to take priest's orders, I
thought it most prudent, first, to go and see for myself, and defer prosecuting
the scheme till I returned, to England.</p>

<p>"When I came to Georgia, I found many poor orphans, who, though
taken notice of by the Honourable Trustees, yet, through the neglect of
persons that acted under them, were in miserable circumstances. For
want of a house to breed them up in, the poor little ones were tabled out
here and there, and, besides the hurt they received by bad examples,
forgot at home what they learnt at school. Others were at hard services,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
and likely to have no education at all. Upon seeing this, I thought
I could not better shew my regard to God and my country, than by
getting a house and land for these children, where they might learn to
labour, read, and write, and, at the same time, be brought up in the
nurture and admonition of the Lord.</p>

<p>"Accordingly, at my return to England in the year 1738, to take priest's
orders, I applied to the Honourable Society for a grant of five hundred
acres of land, and laid myself under an obligation to build a house upon
it, and to receive, from time to time, as many orphans as the land and
stock would maintain.</p>

<p>"As I had always acted like a clergyman of the Church of England,
and had preached in many of the London churches,&mdash;and as I had but a
few months before collected nearly £1000 for the children belonging to
the charity schools in London and Westminster,&mdash;it was natural to
think that I might now have the use of some of these churches to preach
in, for the orphans of Georgia. But, by the time I had taken priest's
orders, the clergy began to be much embittered. Churches were gradually
denied to me; and I must let this good design drop, or preach in the
fields. Indeed, two churches, one in Spitalfields and one in Bristol, were
lent me upon this occasion; but these were all.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> However, God kept me
from being discouraged. I collected for the Orphan House in Moorfields
£52, one Sabbath-day morning, £22 of which were in copper. The people
offered willingly, and took more pains to come through the crowd to put
their contributions into my hat, than some would to have gotten them.
In the afternoon, I collected again at Kennington Common;<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> and continued
to do so at most of the places where I preached. Besides this,
two or three bishops and several persons of distinction contributed; till,
at length, having about £1010, I gave over collecting, and went with what
I had to Georgia. Multitudes offered to go with me; but I chose to
take only a surgeon and a few more of both sexes, who I thought would be
useful in carrying on my design. These cheerfully embarked with me,
desiring nothing for their pains, but food and raiment. My dear fellow-traveller,
William Seward, Esq., also joined with them, and was particularly
useful to me. Our first voyage was to Philadelphia, where I was
willing to go for the sake of laying in provision. In January, 1739, I met
my family in Georgia; and, being unwilling to lose any time, I hired a
large house, and took in all the orphans I could find in the colony. Most
of the orphans were in poor case; and three or four were almost eaten up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
with lice. About the month of March, I began the great house, having
only about £150 in cash. I called it Bethesda, because I hoped it would
be a house of mercy to many souls."<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the above extract, Whitefield says certain bishops and
persons of distinction contributed to his Orphan House in
Georgia. The bishops who contributed were, Dr. Benson,
Bishop of Gloucester, £10 10s.; and Dr. Butler, Bishop of
Bristol, £5 5s. The "persons of distinction" included Lady
Cox, £5 5s. Her sister, Madam Bridget Bethel £5 5s.;
Lady Betty Hastings, £10; the Rev. Mr. Kinchin, £2 2s.;
Rev. Mr. Broughton, £1 1s.; Rev. Westley Hall, £5 5s.;
Rev. Benjamin Ingham, £1 1s.; (the four last mentioned
were Oxford Methodists.) Whitefield himself, £80 10s.;
William Seward, Esq., £100; Benjamin Seward, Esq., £50;
the Honourable Dixey Windsor, £5 5s.; Rev. Mr. Radliff,
Master of Pembroke College, £1 1s.; Rev. Dr. Doddridge,
£1 1s.; John Thorold, Esq., £5 5s.; Mr. James Hutton,
£2 2s.; Howell Harris, £1 1s.; the Countess of Egmont,
£5 5s.; Rev. Henry Piers, 10s. 6d.</p>

<p>Whitefield's Report, published in 1741, contains other
interesting items. For instance, besides those already mentioned,
collections were made by Whitefield in other places,
amounting to £227 4s. 9d.; and to these must be added "a
collection by the Rev. Mr. Cole, Dissenting minister at Gloucester,
£12 10s.;" and also the collections and subscriptions
raised in America, making a total of £2530 2s. 9d. And even
this was not all. William Seward contributed four horses;
Mr. Hugh Bryan, of South Carolina, gave a canoe, eleven
barrels of rice, five barrels of beef, and six sheep; Mr.
Hazelton, of the same province, five sheep, six geese, and
four turkeys; divers friends at Charleston gave him linen,
china, a hogshead of molasses, 250 lb. of wool, a cow, five
sugar-loaves, nine hams, and a bag of coffee; and friends
in Pennsylvania contributed cheeses, hams, hung beef,
children's stays, shirts, about ten thousand bricks, and "a
large folio Turkey-leather Bible." Among the items of
expenditure were the following:&mdash;Sarah Greenhough, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
London, for eighty-four pairs of shoes, £5 1s. 6d.; John
Bray, for mortars, stills, etc., £20 1s. 10d.; James Hutton,
for surgery books, £3 4s. 8d.; Isaac Burton, for two wigs,
£2 6s.; Robert Norman, for gunpowder, £19; Mr. Day,
for drawing a plan for the Orphan House, £2 10s.;
passage for eleven persons to Georgia, £87 5s. 6d:; Mr.
Hugh Bryan, for twenty-one cows, twenty-one calves, a bull,
two horses, a mare, a colt, and ten sows, £65 18s. 6<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub>d.;
for two servants <em>bought</em> of Mr. George Cuthbert, £12;
Captain Mackay, for 15,700 shingles, £7 17s.; Isaac
Young, for cartage of 28,000 bricks, a mare, and two
drawing steers, £23 6s.; Hugh Wire, for 1365 lb. of pork,
£9 3s.; ten cows and calves, £30; eighteen cows, £36;
one bull, £1; forty-eight hogs and eight sheep, £20;
Hugh Ross, for fencing the gardens, £41 12s. 8d.;
several labourers, for fencing the whole 500 acres, £37 3s.
"The total of cash paid for the Orphan House since it
was settled December, 1739, £3,358 7s. 5<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub>d.;" leaving a
deficiency in December, 1741, of £828 4s. 8<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub>d.</p>

<p>Almost all the building materials used in the erection
of the Orphan House had to be conveyed from Savannah, a
distance of about a dozen miles; and, there being no road
between Bethesda and Savannah, one of the items of expenditure
in Whitefield's financial statement is, "Paid labourers
who are employed in clearing land, going in boats, tending on
carpenters and bricklayers, and in making a cart road, near
twelve miles, from Savannah to Bethesda, £258 14s. 4<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub>d.,
besides their provisions." For thirty years, Bethesda was the
object of Whitefield's constant solicitude. "It compelled
him to travel, and inspired him to preach." James Habersham,
one of those who went out with him in 1738, was his
factotum, and, for many years, rendered most valuable service.
This comparatively humble man afterwards rose to considerable
distinction. He became governor of the province
of Georgia; he was the father of Joseph Habersham, the
distinguished patriot whom Washington, in 1795, appointed
Post-Master General of the United States; and he was also
one of the executors of Whitefield's will. The <em>Honourable</em>
James Habersham will be often mentioned in the succeeding
pages. It is now time, however, to return to Whitefield's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
diary and letters. He reached Savannah on January 10,
1740, and the next day went to Bethesda. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1740. Friday, January 11. Went this morning, with some friends, to
view a tract of land, consisting of five hundred acres, which Mr. Habersham,
whom I left schoolmaster of Savannah, was directed, I hope by
Providence, to make choice of for the Orphan House. It is situated on
the northern part of the colony, about ten miles from Savannah, and has
various kinds of soil in it; a part of it very good. Some acres, through
the diligence of my friend, are cleared. He has also stocked it with
cattle and poultry. He has begun the fence, and built a hut. I choose
to have it so far off the town, because the children will be more free from
bad examples. It is my design to have each of the children taught to
labour, so as to be qualified to get their own living."</p></blockquote>

<p>Oddly enough, there is here a break in Whitefield's
Journal, the next entry being dated January 24th; but the
following extracts will help to fill the chasm. William
Stephens, Esq., in his "Journal of the Proceedings in
Georgia," published in 1742, writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1740. January 11. Mr. Whitefield, accompanied by three or four others,
arrived at Savannah. Mr. Norris quietly gave up the church to Mr.
Whitefield. Mr. Whitefield gave to me a document relating to the land
on which to build his Orphan House. I told him that Mr. Habersham
had already applied to General Oglethorpe, when he was at Savannah,
and that the general had ordered five hundred acres to be run out, and
had signed a warrant for this; and that, accordingly, Mr. Habersham
had taken possession of the five hundred acres, and begun fencing and
clearing it.</p>

<p>"January 13. Mr. Whitefield's name, which of late has made so much
noise in England, could not fail in drawing all sorts of people to the
church. Both morning and evening, he made justification by faith only
the subject of his discourse; which he pressed home with great energy,
denouncing anathemas on all such as taught otherwise.</p>

<p>"January 15. Mr. Norris goes as clergyman to Frederica. Mr. Whitefield
has employed nearly all the sawyers, carpenters, and bricklayers in
Savannah, to build his Orphan House, on the five hundred acres, which
Mr. Habersham selected, about ten miles from Savannah.</p>

<p>"January 20. Mr. Whitefield read prayers at seven; again at ten, with
a sermon; again at three, with a sermon; a lecture at seven; besides the
sacrament after the second morning service, when he administered to
between thirty and forty. Both the sermons were on Justification and
Regeneration. I hope for one on Good Works before long."</p></blockquote>

<p>During the thirteen days omitted in his Journal, Whitefield
was not only preaching and looking after the affairs of
Bethesda, but writing letters, some of which were of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
interest and importance. To the Rev. Ralph Erskine he
wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Savannah</span>, <em>January 16, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You may depend on my not being
prejudiced against you or your brethren, by any evil report. They only
endear you to me more and more; and were your enemies to represent
you as black as hell, I should think you the more glorious in the sight of
heaven. I assure you, dear sir, I am fully convinced of the doctrine of
election, free justification, and final perseverance. My observations on
the Quakers were only intended for those particular persons with whom
I then conversed. The tenets of the Quakers in general, about justification,
I take to be false and unscriptural. Your adversaries need take no
advantage against you by anything I have written; for I think it every
minister's duty to declare against the corruptions of that church to which
he belongs. This is your case in Scotland, and ours in England. I see
no other way for us to act at present, than to go on preaching the truth
as it is in Jesus; and then, if our brethren cast us out, God will direct us
to take that course which is the most conducive to His glory and His
people's good. I think I have but one objection against your proceedings,&mdash;your
insisting only on <em>Presbyterian government</em>, exclusive of all
other ways of worshipping God. Will not this necessarily lead you
(whenever you get the upper hand) to oppose and persecute all that differ
from you in their church government, or outward way of worshipping
God? Our dear brother and fellow-labourer, Mr. Gilbert Tennent, thinks
this will be the consequence, and said he would write to you about it.
For my own part, though I profess myself a minister of the Church of
England, I am of a catholic spirit; and, if I see any man who loves the
Lord Jesus in sincerity, I am not very solicitous to what outward communion
he belongs.</p>

<p>"God is doing great things in America. My Journal, which I send
with this, will shew you what He has done already. Affairs of the
Orphan House go on well. Some few, even here, love the Lord Jesus.
Oh, dear sir, pray for us, and especially for your weak, unworthy brother
and fellow-labourer in Christ,,</p>

<p>To Mr. Gilbert Tennent, Whitefield wrote the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Savannah</span>, <em>January 22, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My honoured Friend and Brother in Christ</span>,&mdash;I have experienced
many inward trials since I last saw you; but I find they work
continually for my good. I have received a sweet, endearing, instructive
letter from Mr. Ralph Erskine. I have answered it, and told him you
promised to write about the necessity of a catholic spirit. Dr. Colman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
also has favoured me with a loving epistle. I have read his sermons since
I saw you. They are acute and pointed, but I think not searching enough
by many degrees. I love writers that go to the bottom. I hope to be with
you at the Synod; but I sometimes doubt whether I shall have sufficient
matter given me to preach upon. Michael and the dragon, I hear, are
carrying on war most bravely in England. I really believe we shall not
die, till we see the kingdom of God come with power. The affairs of the
Orphan House are in great forwardness. I have much to say, but time
and business will not permit. Blessed be God, eternity is at hand, and
then we shall have time enough. I have read some of your books to my
great profit. I want to be taught the way of God more perfectly, etc.</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield.</span>"
</p></blockquote>

<p>An extract from another letter, belonging to this period,
deserves insertion. It was addressed "to the Inhabitants of
Maryland, Virginia, and North and South Carolina."</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Savannah</span>, <em>January 23, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"As I lately passed through your provinces, I was touched with a
fellow-feeling of the miseries of the poor negroes. Could I have preached
more frequently among you, I should have delivered my thoughts in my
public discourses; but, as business here required me to stop as little as
possible on the road, I have no other way to discharge the concern that
lies upon my heart than by sending you this letter. How you will receive
it, I know not; but, whatever be the event, I must inform you, in the
meekness and gentleness of Christ, that I think God has a quarrel with
you, for your cruelty to the poor negroes. Whether it be lawful for
Christians to buy slaves, I shall not take upon me to determine;<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> but sure
I am it is sinful, when bought, to use them worse than brutes; and, I
fear, the generality of you, who own negroes, are liable to such a charge;
for your slaves, I believe, work as hard as the horses whereon you ride.</p>

<p>"These, after they have done their work, are fed and taken proper care
of; but many negroes, when wearied with labour in your plantations, have
been obliged to grind their own corn after they return home.</p>

<p>"Your dogs are caressed and fondled at your tables; but your slaves,
who are frequently styled dogs or beasts, have not an equal privilege.
They are scarce permitted to pick up the crumbs which fall from their
masters' tables. Nay, some, as I have been informed by an eye-witness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
have been, upon the most trifling provocation, cut with knives, and have
had forks thrown into their flesh: not to mention what numbers have been
given up to the inhuman usage of cruel task-masters, who, by their unrelenting
scourges, have ploughed upon their backs, and made long furrows,
and, at length, brought them even to death itself.</p>

<p>"I hope there are but few such monsters of barbarity suffered to subsist
among you. Some, I hear, have been lately executed in Virginia for
killing slaves; and the laws are very severe against such as murder them.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it might be better for the poor creatures themselves to be
hurried out of life, than to be made so miserable as they generally are in
it. Indeed, considering the usage they commonly meet with, I have wondered
that we have not more instances of self-murder among them, or that
they have not more frequently risen in arms against their owners. Virginia
has been once, and Charleston more than once, threatened in this way.
And, though I pray God the slaves may never be permitted to get the upper
hand, yet, should such a thing be permitted by Providence, all good men
must acknowledge the judgment would be just. Is it not the highest
ingratitude, as well as cruelty, not to let your poor slaves enjoy some fruits
of their labour? Whilst I have viewed your plantations cleared and
cultivated, and have seen many spacious houses built, and the owners of
them faring sumptuously every day, my blood has almost run cold within
me, when I have considered how many of your slaves had neither convenient
food to eat, nor proper raiment to put on, notwithstanding most
of the comforts you enjoy were solely owing to their indefatigable labours.
The Scripture says, 'Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the
corn.' Does God take care of oxen? And will He not take care of
negroes? Undoubtedly He will. 'Go to now, ye rich men, weep and
howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.' Behold, the provision
of the poor negroes, which have reaped down your fields, which is by you
denied them, 'crieth, and the cries of them which have reaped are entered
into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield's letter to the slave-owners was printed, and,
as will soon be seen, its bold speaking brought him into
trouble. Meanwhile, in his church at Savannah, he not only
continued to preach on his favourite subjects, justification and
the new birth, but he announced that he would administer
the sacrament on all Sundays and holidays. On February 3,
in his sermon, he denounced the clergy as "slothful shepherds
and dumb dogs," and declared his opinion that "the
author of 'The Whole Duty of Man' had sent thousands to
hell." This created another feud; and, as if this were not
enough, on March 7 he quarrelled with Mr. Norris, the late
minister at Savannah, and charged him with preaching false
doctrine, with fiddling, and with playing at cards with ladies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
and told him he should never again assist him in administering
the sacrament.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>Of course, Whitefield was also busily occupied with his
Orphanage. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Tuesday, January 29. Took in three German orphans, the most
pitiful objects, I think, I ever saw. No new negroes could look more
despicable, or require more pains to instruct them. Were all the money
I have collected to be spent in freeing these three children from slavery,
it would be well laid out. I have also in my house near twenty more,
who, in all probability, if not taken in, would be as ignorant of God and
Christ as the Indians. Blessed be God, they begin to live in order.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, January 30. Went with the carpenter and surveyor, and
laid out the ground whereon the Orphan House is to be built. It is to be
sixty feet long, and forty wide. The foundation is to be brick, and is to
be sunk four feet within, and raised three feet above the ground! The
house is to be two stories high, with a hip-roof: the first ten, the second
nine feet high. In all, there will be near twenty commodious rooms. Behind
are to be two small houses, the one for an infirmary, the other for a workhouse.
There is also to be a still-house for the apothecary; and, I trust,
before my return to England, I shall see the children and family quite
settled. I find it will be an expensive work; but it is for the Lord Christ.
He will take care to defray all charges. The money that will be spent,
on this occasion, will keep many families from leaving the colony. There
are near thirty working at the plantation already, and I would employ as
many more, if they were to be had.</p>

<p>"Monday, February 4. Met, according to appointment, all the magistrates,
who heard the recorder read the grant given me by the trustees,
and took a minute of their approbation of the same.</p>

<p>"Monday, February 11. Took in four fresh orphans, and set out, with
two friends, to Frederica, in order to pay my respects to General Oglethorpe,
and to fetch the orphans in the southern parts of the colony.</p></blockquote>

<p>Seventeen days were spent in this journey to the south
of Georgia; but, before following Whitefield, further extracts
from his letters may be welcome. To Mr. William Delamotte,
who had joined the Moravians, and who, with
Benjamin Ingham, was converting hundreds in Yorkshire,<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
Whitefield wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Savannah, January 31, 1740. Blessed be God, for the good report
I hear of your zeal for our dear Immanuel. Go on. I am persuaded the
pleasure of the Lord will prosper in your hands. God blesses the affairs
of the Orphan House. The work is large, but we have omnipotence for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
our support. I believe I shall take in near fifty children. Fear not to
speak the truth: if driven out of England, here is a noble range for you
in America."</p></blockquote>

<p>To the Rev. William Tennent, he addressed the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Savannah, January 31, 1740. I am abashed to think what our all-gracious
Redeemer has done by my unworthy hands, and rejoice to hear
that He is working by yours. God willing, I hope to be with you at the
synod. I find as yet I scarce know anything; but if I give out of my little
stock, I trust the Lord will increase it, as He did the little lad's loaves and
fishes. My Journal, which I have sent to Philadelphia, will tell you what
God has done in Maryland and Virginia. I believe a foundation of
great things is laying there."</p></blockquote>

<p>To a "sister" he sent the ensuing account of his Calvinian
experience:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Savannah, January 31, 1740. Nothing so much comforts my soul as
the thought that God will never leave me. If He does, it must be for
my unworthiness; but, on that account, it cannot be; for He never chose
me on account of my worthiness. He loved me freely; He prevented
me by His grace; He chose me from eternity; He called me in time;
and, I am persuaded, will keep me till time shall be no more. This
consideration makes my faith to work by love. Now I can live not
barely upon my feelings, which are blessed things, but on the promises.
Though I fall, I know I shall rise again. The Lord Jesus will not suffer
the purchase of His blood to be lost. He knew for whom He died, and
neither men nor devils shall ever pluck them out of His hands. I hope,
ere long, our brethren will lay all carnal reasoning aside, and see and
preach the truth, in this respect, as it is in Jesus."</p></blockquote>

<p>To Mr. Noble, of New York, he wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Savannah, January 31, 1740. I purpose to revisit New York at the
appointed time. You told me, 'our Lord has not sent me into His vineyard
at my own charge.' Indeed, I always find He furnishes me with
things convenient. Nay, He is often so abundant in goodness and truth,
that I am obliged to cry out, in holy admiration, 'My Lord and my God!'
Blessed be God, the Orphan-house affairs succeed well. Many souls will
be redeemed by it from temporal, and, I trust, from eternal bondage. I
am building a large house, have many servants, and a good stock of cattle.
It will cost much money; but our Lord will see to that. My friends at
New York will assist me when I come amongst them."</p></blockquote>

<p>Howell Harris, the brave Welshman, always occupied a
warm place in Whitefield's large and loving heart. The
following was addressed to him:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Savannah, Feb. 4, 1740. Will this find you in prison, or not? Your
last letter gave me some expectation, that, ere long, you would be both in
prison and bonds. By-and-by, I shall follow perhaps. My dear brother,
let us continue instant in season and out of season. Let us continually
preach up free grace, though we die for it. We cannot lose our lives in a
better cause. As I am enabled, I remember you at the throne of grace.
In general, I sigh out my prayers. I have not had much enlargement in
preaching since I have been here. I sometimes think my heart is more
vicious and perverse than any one's; and yet Jesus Christ will come and
dwell in me. Methinks I hear you say, 'Glory be to free grace! All
praise be given to electing love!' Let all who love the Lord Jesus say,
Amen!"</p></blockquote>

<p>In his seventeen days' journey to the southern part of
Georgia, Whitefield came to the Scots' settlement at Darien,
and was kindly received by Mr. McLeod, the Presbyterian
minister. Thence he proceeded to Frederica, where he was
courteously treated by General Oglethorpe. He preached in
a room belonging to the storehouse, and "the general, the
soldiers, and the people attended very orderly." Returning
to Darien, he preached five sermons to Mr. McLeod's congregation.
On February 26, he set out with four orphans,
lay two nights in the woods, and reached Bethesda, at noon,
on the 28th. A fortnight afterwards, he embarked for
Charleston. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1740. Friday, March 14. Arrived last night at Charleston, being
called there to see my brother, who lately came from England. Waited
on the commissary" (the Rev. Alexander Garden), "but met with a cool
reception. Drank tea with the Independent minister, and preached to a
large auditory in his meeting-house.</p>

<p>"Saturday, March 15. Breakfasted, sung a hymn, and had some religious
conversation on board my brother's ship. Preached in the Baptist
meeting-house; and, in the evening, again in the Independent meeting-house,
to a more attentive auditory than ever.</p>

<p>"Sunday, March 16. Preached, at eight in the morning, in the Scots'
meeting-house, to a large congregation. Went to church and heard the
commissary represent me under the character of the Pharisee, who came
to the temple, saying, 'God, I thank Thee that I am not as other men are.'
Went to church again in the afternoon; and, about five, preached in the
Independent meeting-house yard, the house not being capacious enough
to hold the auditory.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>
<p>"Monday, March 17. Preached, in the morning, in the Independent
meeting-house, and was more explicit than ever in exclaiming against
balls and assemblies. Preached again in the evening, and, being excited
thereto by some of the inhabitants, I spoke in behalf of the poor orphans,
and collected upwards of £70 sterling, the largest collection I ever yet
made on that occasion.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, March 18. Preached twice again this day, and took an
affectionate leave of my hearers. I believe a good work is begun in
many. Every day several have come to me, telling me, with weeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
eyes, how God had been pleased to convince them by the word preached.
Invitations were given me from some of the adjacent villages, and many
came to town daily, from their plantations, to hear the word.</p>

<p>"Friday, March 21. Went on board the sloop, prayed, sung a hymn,
and took an affectionate leave of my dear brother and other friends. Got
over the bar, and reached Savannah about noon.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, March 25. Went to Bethesda, and, with full assurance of
faith, laid the first brick of the great house. The workmen attended, and
with me kneeled down and prayed. After we had sung a hymn suitable
to the occasion, I gave a word of exhortation to the labourers, and bid
them remember to work heartily, knowing that they worked for God.
Near forty children are now under my care, and near a hundred mouths
are daily supplied with food. The expense is great, but our great and
good God, I am persuaded, will enable me to defray it.</p>

<p>"Sunday, March 30. Found myself sick and weak in body, but was
strengthened to go through most of the duties of the day, and to take an
affectionate leave of my parishioners, because it appeared that Providence
called me towards the northward."</p></blockquote>

<p>This northern journey occupied the next two months;
but, before narrating its incidents, some of Whitefield's
troubles must be mentioned. Like all impulsive men, he
was frequently imprudent, and, naturally enough, imprudence
engendered mischief.</p>

<p>From the foregoing extracts it will be seen that Whitefield
was denounced, from the pulpit, by the Rev. Alexander
Garden, M.A., Rector of St. Philip's, Charleston.<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Remembering
all that had occurred during Whitefield's visit to
England in 1739, and also remembering that, since his
return to America, Whitefield had preached more frequently
in Dissenting meeting-houses than in his own parish church at
Savannah, it is not surprising that Mr. Garden gave Whitefield
"a cool reception" when he went to Charleston. It is matter
of regret, however, that he should have used the pulpit to
proclaim his displeasure; and it is a matter of additional
regret, that the youthful evangelist copied, to any extent, so
objectionable an example. It is said that, while Alexander
Garden expatiated on the text, "Those who have turned the
world upside-down are come hither also," George Whitefield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
retorted by enlarging on the words, "Alexander the coppersmith
hath done me much evil: the Lord reward him according
to his works."<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>But this was not all. Early in the year, a small
pamphlet of sixteen pages was published, with the following
title: "Three Letters from the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield,
namely: Letter 1. To a Friend in London, concerning Archbishop
Tillotson; Letter 2. To the same on the same subject;
Letter 3. To the Inhabitants of Maryland, Virginia,
and North and South Carolina, concerning their Negroes.
Printed and sold by Benjamin Franklin, at the New Printing
Office, near the Market, Philadelphia, 1740."<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>The third of these letters has been already noticed; the
other two must have attention. The first is dated Savannah,
January 18, 1740, and is meant to vindicate Whitefield's
assertion, that "Archbishop Tillotson knew no more of
Christianity than Mahomet." Whitefield writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This has been looked upon as one of the most unjustifiable expressions
that ever proceeded out of my mouth. I dare not say that the expression
came originally from me. My dear and honoured friend, Mr. John Wesley,
if I mistake not, first spoke it in a private Society, where he was expounding
part of the Epistle to the Romans, and proving the doctrine of justification
by faith alone, in contradistinction to good works. But, upon
the maturest deliberation, <em>I</em> say again, what I have often said before, that
Archbishop Tillotson <em>knew no more about true Christianity than Mahomet</em>.
Whatever high opinion others may have of that great man, I must confess
he was never a favourite of mine. My sermon on the eternity of hell's
torments was directly levelled against a discourse of his on that subject;
and, since then, my dislike of him has been much increased, because I
have observed that all natural men generally speak well of his works.
Did he teach the truth as it is in Jesus, thousands, who now admire,
would throw aside his discourses as waste paper. But I would not lay all
the stress of my objections here; but from his own writings will I prove my
assertion. Any spiritual man who reads them may easily see that the
Archbishop knew of no other than a bare historical faith; and, as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
method of our acceptance with God, and our justification by faith alone
(which is the doctrine of Scripture and of the Church of England), he
certainly was as ignorant thereof as Mahomet himself."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield then proceeds to quote extracts from Tillotson's
writings, to prove his assertion. It would have been much
wiser for Whitefield to have kept quiet.</p>

<p>His second letter concerning Tillotson consists chiefly of
extracts from Dr. Edwards's (late of Cambridge) book,
entitled "The Preacher; shewing the Offices and Employments
of those of that character in the Church." The letter
concludes thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And now, my dear friend, have I been rash in my censure of the
Archbishop, or not? I know, writing or speaking against so learned a
Rabbi is like Luther's writing against the indulgences of the Pope. But, no
matter for that. The mystery of iniquity, wrapped up in the writings of
Archbishop Tillotson, has been hid long enough. It is time now to reveal
it to the world."</p></blockquote>

<p>All this may seem to be heroic; but it was not modest.
The work of young Whitefield was not to attack Archbishop
Tillotson, whose death took place long before Whitefield's
birth; but to preach Jesus Christ. He was soon rebuked&mdash;far
too bitterly, but not undeservedly.</p>

<p>Soon after Whitefield's visit to Charleston, and the
publication of his unwise letters, there appeared a quarto
pamphlet, of fifty-four pages, with the following title: "Six
Letters to the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield. The first, second,
and third on the subject of Justification; the fourth containing
remarks on a pamphlet entitled 'The Case between
Mr. Whitefield and Dr. Stebbing stated;' the fifth containing
remarks on Mr. Whitefield's two Letters concerning Archbishop
Tillotson and the book entitled 'The Whole Duty of
Man;' and the sixth containing remarks on Mr. Whitefield's
second Letter concerning Archbishop Tillotson, and on his
Letter concerning the Negroes. By Alexander Garden,
M.A., Rector of St. Philip's, Charleston, and Commissary
in South Carolina. Together with Mr. Whitefield's Answer
to the first Letter. Boston, 1740."<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>
<p>The first of Mr. Garden's letters dwells on good works, as
springing out of faith, and preceding justification. Whitefield's
"Answer" is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Charleston</span>, <em>March 18, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,&mdash;Both by your conversation, sermon, and letter, I perceive
you are angry over-much. Were I ever so much inclined to dispute, I
should stay till the cool of the day. Your letter more and more confirms
me that my charge against the clergy is just and reasonable. It would be
endless to enter into such a private debate as you, rev. sir, seem desirous
of. You have read my sermon" (on "What think ye of Christ?") "be
pleased to read it again; and, if there be anything contrary to sound
doctrine or the Articles of the Church of England, let the public know
it from the press, and thus let the world judge whether you or my
brethren the clergy have been rashly slandered by, rev. sir, your very
humble servant,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield would not fight, but he made others angry.
Mr. Garden's second letter was on the same subject as his
first, but was free from personal abuse. In the third, the
commissary became ireful. Whitefield is accused of "wilful
and malicious, arrogant and wicked slander," and of using
"miserable distinctions" and "mob harangues." He is
charged with employing "poisoned insinuation, false and
insidious," and is told he has "no talent at proving anything."
In reference to Whitefield's saying, in his Journal,
he has kindled a fire which all the devils in hell will not be
able to extinguish, Mr. Garden remarks: "Alas! the fire
you have kindled is that of slander and defamation,&mdash;a fire
which no devil in hell, nor Jesuit, nor Deist on earth, will
ever go about to extinguish, but will fagot and foment it
with all their might, as too effectually serving their interests."</p>

<p>The fourth letter, dated April 15, 1740, is purely theological;
the fifth is clever, but abusive. Mr. Garden says Whitefield
has "exposed himself to the utmost scorn and contempt of
every reader." "In your mountebank way," the rector continues,
"you have, young David-like, as you fancy, slain
your Goliath" (Tillotson), "but his works and memory will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
long survive after you and your dirty pamphlets are sunk
into oblivion. But might not one such conquest have sufficed
you, as it did young David? No: your noble spirit scorns
only to <em>imitate</em>, but must <em>excel</em>. No sooner have you dispatched
this champion of the uncircumcised in heart and ears, but,
advancing from a David into a knight of <em>Lamanca</em>, you go
straight in pursuit of new adventures! And who unhappily
falls in your way but another son of Anak, the author of
the 'Whole Duty of Man'?<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Down he must come; and
thus you gird yourself for the battle." Then again, because
Whitefield says God has given him "a <em>true</em> knowledge of the
doctrines of grace," Mr. Garden associates him with the Pope
and the Mufti, and calls them "a motley Triumvirate of
Infallibles&mdash;your <em>Reverence</em>, the <em>Pope</em>, and the <em>Mufti</em>! each of
you claiming the gift of the true knowledge of the doctrines
of grace, and yet each denying his claim to the other,&mdash;the
claim the result of the most consummate assurance, wherewith
you jointly and severally disturb and confound the
world."</p>

<p>Mr. Garden's sixth letter is dated July 30, 1740, and
chiefly relates to Whitefield's printed attack on the slave-owners
of Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Mr. Garden
declares "the generality of owners use their slaves with all
due humanity." He thinks the owners, in their respective
colonies, may prosecute Whitefield for slander. He then
retorts on Whitefield as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have heard the <em>report</em> of your <em>cruelty</em> to the poor orphans under
your care, not only in pinching their bellies, but in giving them up to
taskmasters or mistresses, who plow upon their backs, and make long
furrows there, in a very inhuman manner; but would you think it fair and
honest in me, if, on such <em>hearsay or report</em>, I should print and publish a
letter directed to you, pretending a necessity of informing you that God
had a quarrel with you, for your cruelty to the poor orphans?"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>All this priestly vituperation, on both sides, is greatly to
be lamented. It degraded ministerial character; it injured
the cause of Christian truth; it afforded sport to unconverted
men. Whitefield's attack on the clergy in general, and on
Tillotson in particular, was, to say the least, unwise; and
Commissary Garden's replies were unworthy of his character
as a gentleman and Christian minister. Mr. Garden, unfortunately,
will turn up again; but, for the present, he must
be dismissed, that attention may be given to another of
young Whitefield's troubles.</p>

<p>As already stated, on February 4, Whitefield, by appointment,
met the magistrates of Savannah for the purpose of
hearing the Recorder read the document by which the
Trustees of Georgia made Whitefield a grant of five hundred
acres of land. One of the magnates present was Mr. Parker,
who was maintaining two orphan boys of the name of Tondee,
the elder being a well-grown lad of fifteen or sixteen years.
Whitefield claimed the boys for his Orphanage. Parker
objected to part with the older boy, on the ground that,
having maintained him during his childhood, it would be
unfair to take him away now, when he was capable of
working for his living. No doubt, Mr. Parker had reason
on his side; but Whitefield replied, "The boy is much fitter
for my purpose than for yours, as he can be employed for
the benefit of the other orphans." Parker lost his temper;
but Whitefield took away the boys.</p>

<p>Another case, even more daring and high-handed than
this, occurred about the same time. A man of the name of
Mellidge, one of the first forty freeholders of Savannah, died,
and left several young children, towards whom General
Oglethorpe shewed particular favour. After a few years,
the eldest boy, proving himself to be intelligent and industrious,
was employed by the General in planting; and
the eldest girl having become capable of taking care of the
younger children, the whole nest of orphans, in the spring of
1740, found a home in the house of their elder brother John.
On arriving in Georgia, Whitefield very improperly took
possession of all the younger Mellidges, and removed them
to his Orphanage. John, their natural protector, complained
to Oglethorpe. Oglethorpe, who was then at Frederica,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
knowing that the family was now no public incumbrance,
wrote the following sensible letter on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have inspected the grant relating to the Orphan House. Mr. Seward
said that the trustees had granted the orphans to Mr. Whitefield; but I
shewed him that it could not be in the sense he at first seemed to understand
it. The trustees have granted the <em>care</em> of the <em>helpless</em> orphans to
Mr. Whitefield, and have given him five hundred acres of land, and a
power of collecting charities, as a consideration for maintaining all the
orphans who are in necessity in this province; and thereby the trustees
think themselves discharged from the maintaining of any. But, at the
same time, the trustees have not given, as I see, any power to Mr. Whitefield
to receive the effects of the orphans, much less to take by force any
orphans who can maintain themselves, or whom any other substantial
person will maintain. The trustees, in this, act according to the law of
England:&mdash;In case orphans are left destitute, they become the charge of
the parish, and the parish may put them out to be taken care of; but if
any person will maintain them, so that they are not chargeable to the
parish, then the parish doth not meddle with them."</p></blockquote>

<p>Backed by the General's opinion, John Mellidge waited
upon Whitefield, and requested him to permit his brothers
and sisters to return to the home he himself had provided
for them. Whitefield replied, "Your brothers and sisters
are at their proper home already. I know no other home
they have to go to. Give my service to the General, and
tell him so." Oglethorpe was not a man to be trifled
with by a young clergyman; and hence, on hearing young
Mellidge's report, he peremptorily ordered Mr. Jones, a
functionary of Savannah, to remove the children from Whitefield's
Orphanage; and Jones, during Whitefield's absence,
obeyed the order. Whitefield was angry, and threatened to
appeal to the trustees; but the Mellidges prospered, and,
after the expiration of the trustees' charter, John Mellidge,
the valiant protector of the little orphans, became the representative
of Savannah in the first General Assembly of
Georgia.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>It is impossible to justify Whitefield in proceedings like
these; and, certainly, they brought upon him anxiety and
trouble, which, though deserved, he need never have
experienced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>Another unpleasantness, belonging to this period, must be
mentioned. True, it involves no reproach either to one party
or the other; but, no doubt, it was painful to both. Whitefield
had become a Calvinist; but his friend Wesley, eleven
years his senior, and vastly more learned, was an Arminian,
and, moreover, held the doctrine, that, though Christians can
never be freed from "those numberless weaknesses and
follies, sometimes improperly termed sins of infirmity," yet,
it is the privilege of all to be saved "entirely from sin in its
proper sense, and from committing it." He had also recently
published his "Journal from his Embarking for Georgia to
his Return to London;" and also the Life of Halyburton,
with a Preface, in which he propounded the view just mentioned.
Nothing more need be said to illustrate the references
in the following most affectionate and deeply interesting
letter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Savannah</span>, <em>March 26, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Honoured Sir</span>,&mdash;Since I returned here, I received your letter and
journal. I thank you for both, and shall wait almost with impatience to
see a continuance of your account of what God is doing or has done
amongst you. He knows my heart. I rejoice in whatever God has done
by your hands, I, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prae, sequar, etsi non passibus equis</i>.</p>

<p>"I could now send a particular answer to your last; but, my honoured
friend and brother, for once hearken to a child, who is willing to wash your
feet. I beseech you, by the mercies of God in Christ Jesus our Lord, if
you would have my love confirmed towards you, write no more to me about
misrepresentations wherein we differ. To the best of my knowledge, at
present, no sin has <em>dominion</em> over me, yet I feel the strugglings of indwelling
sin day by day. I can, therefore, by no means, come into your interpretation
of the passage mentioned in the letter, and as explained in your Preface to
Mr. Halyburton.</p>

<p>"The doctrine of <em>election</em>, and the <em>final perseverance</em> of those who are
truly in Christ, I am ten thousand times more convinced of, if possible,
than when I saw you last. You think otherwise. Why then should we
dispute, when there is no probability of convincing? Will it not, in the
end, destroy brotherly love, and insensibly take from us that cordial union
and sweetness of soul, which I pray God may always subsist between us?
How glad would the enemies of the Lord be to see us divided! How
many would rejoice, should I join and make a party against you! How
would the cause of our common Master every way suffer by our raising
disputes about particular points of doctrine!</p>

<p>"Honoured sir, let us offer salvation freely to all by the blood of Jesus;
and whatever light God has communicated to us, let us freely communicate
to others. I have lately read the life of Luther, and think it in no wise to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
his honour, that the last part of his life was so much taken up in disputing
with Zwinglius and others, who, in all probability, equally loved the Lord
Jesus, notwithstanding they might differ from him in other points. Let
this, dear sir, be a caution to us. I hope it will to me; for, by the blessing
of God, provoke me to it as much as you please, I do not think ever to
enter the lists of controversy with you on the points wherein we differ.
Only, I pray to God, that the more you <em>judge me</em>, the more I may <em>love
you</em>, and learn to desire no one's approbation, but that of my Lord and
Master Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"Ere this reaches you, I suppose you will hear of my late excursion to
Charleston. A great work, I believe, is begun there. Enclosed, I have
sent you Mr. Garden's letters. They will serve to convince you, more
and more, of the necessity you lie under to be instant in season and out of
season.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear honoured sir, I wish you as much success as your heart can
wish. Were you here, I would weep over you with tears of love, and tell
you what great things God hath done for my soul, since we parted last. I
often and heartily pray for your success in the gospel. May your inward
strength and outward sphere increase day by day! May God use you as
a choice and singular instrument of promoting His glory on earth! And
may I see you crowned with an eternal and exceeding weight of glory in
the world to come! This is the hearty desire of, honoured sir, yours most
affectionately in Christ Jesus,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>An exquisitely beautiful epistle! All must lament that,
soon after this, there was a temporary estrangement between
these faithful and loving men.</p>

<p>Two days after the date of the foregoing letter, Whitefield
wrote to his friend, Benjamin Ingham, and abruptly
announced that he believed it was the will of God that he
should marry; but, at the same time, prayed that he might not
obtain a wife till he could live as though he had none. The
reason of this apparently sudden change was, that of the four
women who had accompanied him from England to manage
his Orphanage in America, one was settled in Philadelphia;
another was dead; the third was dying; and the fourth was
the only one likely to afford him aid. Whitefield had already
fixed his mind upon the young lady whom he intended to
ask to be his wife; but certainly he was one of the oddest
wooers that ever wooed. Hence the following letters&mdash;probably
the first love letters of his life, and, without a
doubt, among the strangest that an educated and thoroughly
unselfish and Christian man ever wrote. The first was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
addressed to the young lady, the object of his choice; the
second to her parents.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">On board the Savannah</span>, <em>April 4, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Miss E&mdash;&mdash;</span>, Be not surprised at the contents of this. The
letter sent to your honoured father and mother will acquaint you with the
reasons.</p>

<p>"Do you think you could undergo the fatigues that must necessarily attend
being joined to one who is every day liable to be called to suffer for
the sake of Jesus Christ? Can you bear to leave your father and kindred's
house, and to trust on Him, who feedeth the young ravens that call upon
Him, for your own and children's support, supposing it should please Him
to bless you with any? Can you undertake to help a husband in the
charge of a family, consisting perhaps of a hundred persons? Can you
bear the inclemencies of the air, both as to cold and heat, in a foreign
climate? Can you, when you have a husband, be as though you had none,
and willingly part with him, even for a long season, when his Lord and
Master shall call him forth to preach the gospel, and command him to
leave you behind?</p>

<p>"If, after seeking to God for direction, and searching your heart, you
can say, 'I can do all these things through Christ strengthening me,'
what if you and I were joined together in the Lord, and you came with
me, at my return from England, to be a helpmeet for me in the management
of the Orphan House? I have great reason to believe it is the
Divine will that I should alter my condition, and have often thought you
were the person appointed for me. I shall still wait on God for direction,
and heartily entreat Him that, if this be not of Him, it may come to nought.</p>

<p>"I write thus plainly, because, I trust, I write not from any other principles
but the love of God. I shall make it my business to call on the
Lord Jesus; and would advise you to consult both Him and your friends.
For, in order to obtain a blessing, we should call both the Lord Jesus and
His disciples to the marriage. I much like the manner of Isaac's marrying
Rebekah; and think no marriage can succeed well, unless both parties concerned
are like-minded with Tobias and his wife.</p>

<p>"I think I can call the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to witness
that I desire to take you, my sister, to wife, not for lust, but uprightly;
and, therefore, I hope He will mercifully ordain, if it be His blessed will
we should be joined together, that we may walk as Zacharias and Elisabeth
did, in all the ordinances of the Lord blameless. I make no great profession
to you, because I believe you think me sincere. The passionate expressions
which carnal courtiers use, I think, ought to be avoided by those
that would marry in the Lord. I can only promise, by the help of God,
to keep my matrimonial vow, and to do what I can towards helping you

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Friends</span>,&mdash;Since I wrote last, we have buried our sister
L&mdash;&mdash;; Rachel I left at Philadelphia; and sister T&mdash;&mdash; seems to be in a
declining state; so that sister A&mdash;&mdash; alone is like to be left of all the
women which came over with me from England.</p>

<p>"I find, by experience, that a mistress is absolutely necessary for the
due management of my increasing family, and to take off some of that
care which, at present, lies upon me. Besides, I shall, in all probability,
at my next return from England, bring more women with me; and I find,
unless they are all truly gracious, (or indeed if they are) without a superior,
matters cannot be carried on as becometh the gospel of Jesus Christ. It
hath been, therefore, much impressed upon my heart that I should marry,
in order to have a helpmeet for me in the work, whereunto our dear Lord
Jesus hath called me.</p>

<p>"This comes, (like Abraham's servant to Rebekah's relations,) to know
whether you think your daughter, Miss E&mdash;&mdash;, is a proper person to
engage in such an undertaking? If so, whether you will be pleased to
give me leave to propose marriage unto her?</p>

<p>"You need not be afraid of sending me a refusal; for, I bless God, if
I know anything of my own heart, I am free from that foolish passion,
which the world calls <em>love</em>. I write, only because I believe it is the will
of God that I should alter my state; but your denial will fully convince
me, that your daughter is not the person appointed by God for me. He
knows my heart; I would not marry but for Him, and in Him, for ten
thousand worlds. But I have sometimes thought Miss E&mdash;&mdash; would be
my helpmeet; for she has often been impressed upon my heart. I should
think myself safer in your family, because so many of you love the Lord
Jesus, and, consequently, would be more watchful over my precious and
immortal soul.</p>

<p>"After strong crying and tears at the throne of grace for direction, and
after unspeakable troubles with my own heart, I write this. Be pleased
to spread the letter before the Lord; and, if you think this motion to be
of Him, be pleased to deliver the enclosed to your daughter: if not, say
nothing, only let me know you disapprove of it, and that shall satisfy,
dear sir and madam, your obliged friend and servant in Christ,</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, Whitefield's curious courtship failed, as it deserved
to fail; but the question naturally arises, Who was
the young lady whom Whitefield proposed to marry?
There cannot be a doubt that "Dear Miss E&mdash;&mdash;" was
Elizabeth Delamotte, the daughter of the Middlesex magistrate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
who lived at Blendon, whose son Charles went with
the Wesleys to Georgia, and whose son William was now a
Moravian preacher, and, (in union with Benjamin Ingham,)
was doing his utmost to convert the benighted inhabitants
of the West Riding of the county of York. The full address
of Whitefield's letter to the parents of "Miss E&mdash;&mdash;"
is not given, the editor of Whitefield's collected works merely
supplying "To Mr. and Mrs. D&mdash;&mdash;," which coincides with
the opinion just expressed. From Charles Wesley's Journal,
it is perfectly clear that one of Mr. Delamotte's daughters was
named Elizabeth.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> The reader need not be told that, during
the summer of 1739, Whitefield was a frequent and delighted
visitor at Mr. Delamotte's house,<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> and that it was
here that he wrote his Answer to the Bishop of London's
Pastoral Letter. Since his return to America, he had written
Mr. Delamotte a most loving letter;<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> and an equally loving
one to Mr. Delamotte's wife,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> both dated "Philadelphia,
November 10, 1739." Indeed, unless I am mistaken, he
had written to Miss Elizabeth herself. Hence the following
extract from a letter "to Miss Elizabeth D&mdash;&mdash;," dated
"Savannah, February 1, 1740":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You do well to go about doing good; your Master did so before you.
Dare, <em>dear Miss</em>, to follow His good example, and never fear the revilings
of men. Set your face as a flint against all the adversaries of our Lord.
Keep up a close walk and communion with God. Nothing else can preserve
you from idols. There is nothing I dread more than having my
heart drawn away by earthly objects. For, alas! what room can there
be for God, when a rival has taken possession of the heart? Oh, my dear
sister, pray that no such evil may befall me. My blood runs cold at the
very thought thereof.</p>

<p>"In a multiplicity of business, have I written you these lines. I thank
you for your kind letter; and hope I shall always retain a grateful sense
of the many favours I have received from your dear family. My kindest
respects attend your sister. I long to hear of her being brought into the
glorious liberty of the children of God. How does your father? how
does my dear brother Charles? and how does your little sister? My
heart is now full. Writing quickens me. I could almost drop a tear,
and wish myself, for a moment or two, in England. But hush, nature!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>

"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>All this is presumptive evidence; the following is direct.
Whitefield wrote his love letters on April 4, 1740. On the
28th day of the same month, he dispatched his friend
Seward to England, on important business. On the 26th
of June next ensuing, he wrote as follows to Mr. Seward:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Savannah</span>, <em>June 26, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Brother Seward</span>&mdash;I have received many agreeable letters
from England; but find, from <em>Blendon letters</em>, that Miss <em>E&mdash;&mdash; D&mdash;&mdash;</em>
is in a seeking state only. Surely that will not do. I would have one
that is full of faith and the Holy Ghost. My poor family gives me more
concern than all things else put together. I want a <em>gracious</em> woman that
is dead to everything but Jesus, and is qualified to govern children, and
direct persons of her own sex. Such a one would help, and not retard,
me in my dear Lord's work. I wait upon the Lord every moment; I
hang upon my Jesus; and He daily assures me He will not permit me to
fall by the hands of a woman. I am almost tempted to wish I had never
undertaken the Orphan House. At other times, I am willing to contrive
matters so that I may not marry. My dearest brother, adieu! By this
time, I trust, you are near England. Take heed that the people you bring
believe on Jesus," etc., etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>The reader will excuse the length of these extracts.
This was really one of the most curious of the little episodes
in Whitefield's life; and no previous biographer has attempted
to shew who the lady was whom Whitefield proposed
to make his wife.</p>

<p>On April 2, Whitefield and William Seward, embarked in
their own sloop, the <em>Savannah</em>, and, after a ten days' voyage,
landed at Newcastle, in the province of Pennsylvania, where
they were kindly entertained by Mr. Grafton. The day
(April 13) being Sunday, and the episcopal minister of the
parish being ill, Whitefield was allowed the use of his pulpit,
and, at once, commenced preaching. After the morning
service, William Seward rode to Christian Bridge, and to
Whiteclay Creek, (where Charles Tennent was the Presbyterian
minister,) for the purpose of announcing that Whitefield
would preach again at Newcastle in the afternoon. Such
was the young preacher's popularity, that the service in the
Presbyterian meeting-house was given up, and Tennent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
above two hundred others mounted their horses, and galloped
to Newcastle, arriving in time to hear Whitefield's sermon
on the conversion of Zaccheus.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Tennent," says Seward, "informed us of the great success which
had attended our brother Whitefield's preaching, when we were here last.
For some time, a general silence was fixed on people's minds, and many
began seriously to think on what foundation they stood. A general outward
reformation has been visible. Many ministers have been quickened,
and congregations are increased."<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>On Monday, April 14, at eleven in the morning, Whitefield
preached at Wilmington to about three thousand, using as
his pulpit the balcony of the house where he lodged. At
night, he and his friends arrived at Philadelphia. Seward
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On our arrival, though late, many friends came to see us, particularly
Mr. Jones, the Baptist minister, who told us of two other ministers, Mr.
Treat and Mr. Morgan, who were so affected by our brother Whitefield's
spirit, that the latter had gone forth preaching towards the sea coast in the
Jerseys, and in many other places; and the former had told his congregation
that he had been hitherto <em>deceiving</em> himself and them, and that he
could not preach again at present, but desired them to join in prayer with
him."<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>No wonder that Whitefield's enthusiastic soul was stirred
within him. In a letter, written on the day he reached
Philadelphia, he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"People are much alarmed already. I find God has been pleased to
do great things, by what He enabled me to deliver when last here. Two
ministers have been convinced of their formal state, notwithstanding they
held and preached the doctrines of grace. One plainly told the congregation
he had been deceiving himself and them, and could not preach any
more, but desired the people to pray with him. The other is now a flame
of fire, and has been much owned of God. Very many, I believe, of late
have been brought savingly to believe on the Lord Jesus. The work
much increases. A primitive spirit revives; and many, I hope, will be
brought to live steadfast in the apostle's doctrine, in fellowship, in breaking
of bread, and in prayer."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield spent nine days, from April 14 to 23, in Philadelphia
and its immediate neighbourhood. The enthusiasm
created by his visit was enormous. His friends erected a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
stage for him on what was called Society Hill, and around
this, as if drawn by magic, his immense congregations
gathered. First of all he applied for the use of the parish
church, but the clergyman refused, because Whitefield had
"written against Archbishop Tillotson."<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Upon this, Whitefield,
as usual, made the open air his church, and, in this
quiet Quaker city, preached to audiences numbering from
five to fifteen thousand people each. Remembering how
recently the city had been founded, and bearing in mind the
sparseness of the surrounding populations, the wonder is
how such vast crowds were drawn together. In this respect,
a congregation of thirty thousand in Moorfields was a small
affair when compared with a congregation of ten thousand
on Society Hill, in Philadelphia. The power accompanying
Whitefield's preaching was marvellous. Numbers, including
several negroes, came to him privately, deeply convinced of
sin, and asking his advice and prayers. The clergyman of
the Church of England preached a sermon, from James ii. 18,
upon justification <em>by works</em>. In the evening of the same day,
Whitefield, on Society Hill, took the same text, and preached,
to about fifteen thousand people, a sermon on justification <em>by
faith</em>, after which he made a collection for his Orphan House,
amounting to £80 currency. This was the <i>second</i> collection,
for the same object, which Whitefield made on that memorable
Sabbath; for, in the early morning, at seven o'clock,
he had preached to about ten thousand, and collected for
his orphans £110 sterling. His friend, William Seward,
with the connivance of the owner, locked the doors, and took
away the keys, of "the Assembly-room, the Dancing School,
and the Music Meeting," promising to pay the proprietor for
any loss he might sustain. The enemies of Whitefield were
enraged by this proceeding, and "some gentlemen," says
Seward, "threatened to cane me."<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> "Scoffers," writes Whitefield,
"muttered in coffee-houses, cursed, drunk a bowl of
punch, and then cried out against me for not preaching up
more morality."<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>Whitefield did not confine his preaching to Philadelphia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
During his nine days' visit, he preached, from a horse-block,
to three thousand people, at Abington,<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> the place where
the Rev. Mr. Treat, already mentioned, had been the minister.
Accompanied by a cavalcade of about forty persons, he rode
to Whitemarsh and to German Town, and preached, in each
place, to assembled thousands. He went to Greenwich, in
the West Jerseys, and to Gloucester, about four miles from
Philadelphia, many of the Philadelphians forming part of
his audience, and singing in the boats all the way there and
back.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin writes respecting Whitefield's present
visit to Philadelphia as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Whitefield preached up this charity" (the Orphan House), "and
made large collections; for his eloquence had a wonderful power over the
hearts and purses of his hearers, of which I myself was an instance. I
did not disapprove of the design; but, as Georgia was then destitute of
materials and workmen, and it was proposed to send them from Philadelphia
at great expense, I thought it would have been better to have
built the house at Philadelphia, and to have brought the children to it.
This I advised; but he was resolute in his first project, and rejected my
counsel; and I, therefore, refused to contribute. I happened soon after
to attend one of his sermons, in the course of which I perceived he intended
to finish with a collection; and I silently resolved he should get nothing
from me. I had, in my pocket, a handful of copper money, three or four
silver dollars, and five pistoles in gold. As he proceeded, I began to
soften, and concluded to give the copper. Another stroke of his oratory
determined me to give the silver; and he finished so admirably that I
emptied my pocket wholly into the collector's dish, gold and all. At this
sermon, there was also one of our club, who, being of my sentiments
respecting the building in Georgia, and suspecting a collection might be
intended, emptied his pockets before he came from home. Towards the
conclusion of the discourse, however, he felt a strong inclination to give,
and applied to a neighbour, who stood near him, to lend him money for
the purpose. The request was fortunately made to, perhaps, the only
man in the company who had the firmness not to be affected by the
preacher. His answer was, 'At any other time, friend Hopkinson, I
would lend thee freely, but not now, for thee seems to me to be out of thy
right senses.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Franklin adds:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"Some of Mr. Whitefield's enemies affected to suppose that he would
apply these collections to his own private emolument; but I, who was
intimately acquainted with him, (being employed in printing his sermons,
journals, etc.,) never had the least suspicion of his integrity; but am, to
this day, decidedly of opinion that he was, in all his conduct, a perfectly
<em>honest man</em>. Our friendship was sincere on both sides, and lasted to his
death. He used sometimes to pray for my conversion, but never had the
satisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard. Upon one of his
arrivals from England, at Boston, he wrote to me that he should come
soon to Philadelphia, but knew not where he could lodge when there, as
his old friend and host, Mr. Benezet, was removed to German Town. My
answer was, 'You know my house. If you can make shift with its scanty
accommodation, you will be most heartily welcome.' He replied that, if
I made that kind offer for <em>Christ's</em> sake, I should not miss of a reward.
And I returned, 'Don't let me be mistaken; it is not for <em>Christ's</em>
sake, but for <em>your</em> sake.' This incident will shew the terms on which we
stood.</p>

<p>"The last time I saw Mr. Whitefield was in London, when he consulted
me about his Orphan-house concern, and his purpose of appropriating it
to the establishment of a college. He had a loud and clear voice,<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> and
articulated his words so perfectly that he might be heard and understood
at a great distance, especially as his auditories observed the most perfect
silence.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> He preached one evening from the top of the Court House steps,
which are in the middle of Market Street, and on the west side of Second
Street, which crosses it at right angles. Both streets were filled with his
hearers to a considerable distance. Being among the hindmost in Market
Street, I had the curiosity to learn how far he could be heard, by retiring
backwards down the street towards the river, and I found his voice distinct
till I came near Front Street, when some noise in that street obscured it.
Imagining then a semicircle, of which my distance should be the radius,
and that it was filled with auditors, to each of whom I allowed two square
feet, I computed that he might well be heard by more than thirty
thousand. By hearing him often, I came to distinguish easily between
sermons newly composed and those which he had often preached in the
course of his travels. His delivery of the latter was so improved by frequent
repetition, that every accent, every emphasis, every modulation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
the voice, was so perfectly well turned and well placed, that, without
being interested in the subject, one could not help being pleased with the
discourse. His writing and printing from time to time, gave great advantage
to his enemies. Unguarded expressions, and even erroneous
opinions, delivered in preaching, might have been afterwards explained or
qualified; but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">litera scripta manet</i>. Critics attacked his writings violently,
and with so much appearance of reason, as to diminish the number of his
votaries, and prevent their increase. So that, I am satisfied that if he
had never written anything, he would have left behind him a much more
numerous and important sect; and his reputation, in that case, would
have been still growing even after his death; because, there being nothing
of his writing on which to found a censure and give him a lower character,
his proselytes would be left at liberty to attribute to him as great a variety
of excellences as their enthusiastic admiration might wish him to have
possessed."<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A testimony such as this from an outsider like Benjamin
Franklin is worth quoting. What about others? The Rev.
John Muirhead, in a letter to the Rev. Ralph Erskine,
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Whitefield, that man of God, came into this town last September,
and preached with surprising success. Consolation and thunder were
intermixed in all his discourses, so that numbers were made to cry out,
'What shall we do to be saved?' While the iron might be said to be
hot, that Boanerges, Mr. Gilbert Tennent, came, and laboured with still
greater success among us. Many hundreds of souls came under great
distress. Lectures are set up and continued almost every day in the
week. God's blessed Spirit is poured out on some of all ages and complexions.
God has perfected praise from the mouths of many hundreds
of children. Many poor Ethiopians are made to stretch out their hands
to God. In my little congregation, a hundred and seventy-eight souls
have applied to me, either to relate what God had done for them, or to
ask direction how to manage under soul trouble. One thing I would
notice, the work of Christ has been greater since these men of God have
gone hence; but they brought the sacred fire along with them, and now
it is kindled into a divine flame. God has made many townships and
ministers light tapers at our torches; namely, Roxburg, Brookline, Cambridge,
Charleston, Ipswich, Newburg, Rhode Island, with many more
towns through almost all the provinces of English America. I do not
know that I have ever read anything like this blessed time since the
apostles' days."<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Another writer observes:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"The effects produced, in Philadelphia, by the preaching of Mr. Whitefield
were astonishing. Numbers of almost all religious denominations
and many who had no connection with any denomination, were brought
to enquire, with the utmost earnestness, what they should do to be saved.
Such was the engagedness of multitudes to listen to spiritual instruction, that
there was public worship, regularly, twice a day, for a year; and, on the
Lord's-day, it was celebrated generally thrice, and frequently four times.
The city contained twenty-six societies for social prayer and religious
conference. So great was the enthusiasm to hear Mr. Whitefield preach,
that many from Philadelphia followed him on foot to Chester, to Abington,
to Neshaminy, and some even to New Brunswick, in New Jersey, the
distance of sixty miles. In 1743, a church was formed by Mr. Gilbert
Tennent out of those who were denominated converts of Mr. Whitefield.
No less than a hundred and forty individuals were received at first, after
a strict examination, as members of this newly constituted church. The
admission of a large number more was delayed, only because their spiritual
state had not yet attained such maturity as to afford satisfaction to the
officers of the church; but among those received on the first examination
was the eminent Christian whose story is here recorded, and who was to
be, for more than sixty years, one of the church's brightest ornaments."<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield was thus, under God, the means of creating a
Presbyterian church in Philadelphia. But more than this.
A permanent building was erected for the use of the Tennents
and their associates; and this building afterwards became
the seat of the University of Pennsylvania.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Here Whitefield
preached whenever he visited the city, and here his friends,
the Tennents, together with Messrs. Rowland, Blair, and
Finley, ministered during his absence.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>One other important transaction occurred during this nine
days' visit to Philadelphia. Besides sustaining the Orphan
House in Georgia, Whitefield formed a project, 1. To erect
a school for negroes in Pennsylvania; and 2. To found a
settlement, in the same province, as a sort of refuge for such
of his English converts as might be persecuted for conscience'
sake. On April 22, William Seward wrote as
follows: "Agreed with Mr. Allen<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> for five thousand acres
of land on the forks of the Delaware, at £2,200 sterling;
the conveyance to be made to Mr. Whitefield, and after
that assigned to me, as security for my advancing the
money."<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>Immediately after this, William Seward set sail for England.
Hence the following letter,<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> addressed to "Mr. Blackwell, at
Mr. James Martin and Co.'s, bankers, in Lombard Street,
London." The letter has not before been published.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Written at Sea</span>, <em>June 9, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"(To be put in the post, on my landing at Dover or Deal.)</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Blackwell</span>,&mdash;I am sent over by Brother Whitefield, on
several affairs of consequence to the Church of Christ: particularly to
fetch Brother Hutchins to supply Brother Whitefield's place at the Orphan
House, while he comes to England himself next spring; also to transact
several matters with the Trustees of Georgia; and to make collections for
a negro school in the province of Pennsylvania, where we have bought
5,000 acres of very good land for that purpose, and for settling such
English friends upon as God shall incline to go over next year, in a ship
we shall buy, and to be commanded by Captain Gladman, who comes
with me.</p>

<p>"The land, by my desire, is conveyed to Brother Whitefield, but
mortgaged to me for £2,200, the purchase-money. I think it is as good a
security as the Bank of England,&mdash;perhaps better; but you know we aim
not at an earthly, but a heavenly inheritance. Still, we must provide things
honest in the sight of all men.</p>

<p>"I design to land at Dover or Deal, and to call at Blendon for one night,
or two at most; and, as I must raise money to answer the bills of exchange
I have drawn for the sum aforesaid, I desire you, if you can conveniently,
to sell for me £1,650 old South Sea annuities, and £585 4s. 5d. South
Sea stock. If not convenient to you, desire Mr. Cole to do it; and (God
willing) I shall be in town two or three days afterwards to sign the transfers.
But, first of all, please to enquire if there be any alteration made in these
by my brother Benjamin, with whom I left general letters of attorney.
When you have done the business, please to write me a penny-post letter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
to Mr. John Bray's, brazier, in Little Britain, where I am to lodge while
in town.</p>

<p>"I am sorry my paper is so crowded with business that I have no room
to enlarge upon the great things God has done for us in Savannah,
Charleston, Philadelphia, New Jersey, New York, and other places. The
light of the glorious gospel of Jesus Christ has shone into many hearts,
as you may judge by our collecting £210 sterling, for the Orphan House,
at three sermons in Charleston and Philadelphia. Help us to give thanks
for the abundant mercy and grace bestowed upon us since we saw you.
The Lord preserved us in travelling about 1400 miles by land, and 10,000
by water. Though in many perils, out of all the Lord delivered us.</p>

<p>"My stay in England may be three months, between London, Bristol,
Gloucester, etc. Pray that I may have good success in all things, that so
I may quickly return to our dear friends in Georgia. I have a letter for
you from our dear brother Whitefield.</p>

<p class="sig">"Your unworthy brother in Christ,<br />
"<span class="smcap">William Seward</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The whole of this benevolent design collapsed. William
Seward landed in England on the 19th of June; and, four
months afterwards, was killed by a brutal persecutor in the
principality of Wales. This put an end to the affair; and
Pennsylvanian negroes and English refugees were left to the
care of Providence.</p>

<p>On April 23, Whitefield proceeded from Philadelphia to
Neshaminy, where he was warmly welcomed, and preached,
in the yard of the Presbyterian meeting-house, to above
five thousand people. The next day, he preached, first at
Shippack, "a very wilderness part of the country," but where
two thousand hearers were assembled. Here he met the
celebrated Moravian, Peter Bohler, who preached in Dutch,
after he had finished. Riding ten miles farther, (forty from
Philadelphia,) he came to Henry Anti's plantation, and
addressed about three thousand. The evening was spent
most pleasantly, the Dutch praying and singing in <em>their</em>
language, and Whitefield praying in <em>his</em>.</p>

<p>On April 25, he rode to Amwell, and preached to five
thousand. Here he was met by Gilbert Tennent, Mr. Rowland,
Mr. Wales, and Mr. Campbell, four godly Presbyterian
ministers, who had given the people three gospel sermons
before his arrival. He and his friends spent the evening in
singing and praying in the fields. The day following he
reached New Brunswick, where his friend Gilbert Tennent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
was minister. Sunday, April 27, was a notable day. He
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I preached morning and evening," (at New Brunswick,) "to near seven
or eight thousand people; and God's power was so much amongst us in
the afternoon sermon, that the cries and groans of the people would have
drowned my voice. One woman was struck down; and, at night, another
woman came to me under strong convictions. She cried out, 'I can see
nothing but hell.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>The afternoon sermon was preached by Gilbert Tennent,
from the text, "I will search Jerusalem with candles, and
punish them that are settled on their lees." William
Seward adds, that the collections, morning and evening, were
about £25 sterling.</p>

<p>During his brief sojourn at New Brunswick, Whitefield
wrote a long letter, referring, among other things, to the
Pennsylvanian scheme just mentioned. It was printed,
with the following title: "A Letter from the Rev. Mr.
George Whitefield to a Friend in London. Dated at
New Brunswick, in New Jersey, April 27, 1740. Printed
by W. Strahan, 1740." (8vo. 8 pp.) Only a part of this
letter is given in Whitefield's collected works; and the
following is a mere extract from the original:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Orphan-house affairs go forward beyond expectation. I have
upwards of forty children now in my house at Savannah, near seventy
persons in family, and upwards of a hundred to provide for every day.
As yet, we want for nothing. The great Householder of mankind gives
us all things richly to enjoy. I had rather <em>live by faith, and depend on
God</em>, for the support of my great and increasing family, than have the
largest <em>visible fund</em> in the universe. About five weeks ago, the Charleston
people contributed upwards of £70 sterling, towards the support of
my little ones. A glorious work was also begun in the hearts of the
inhabitants. Many negroes, likewise, are in a fair way of being brought
home to God. In my public discourses, I have freely offered the Lord
Jesus to them, if they will believe on Him; and have actually taken up
five thousand acres of very good land, in order to erect a school for the
education and maintenance of all such negroes, whether young or old, as
shall be sent to me. Young ones I intend to buy, and do not despair of
seeing shortly a room full of that <em>despised generation</em>, making melody with
grace in their heart unto the Lord. Here, also, my dear English friends,
if persecution should come upon them, may find a refuge from the storm.
The land is good, and will yield a great increase, and all may here worship
God in their own way. Many apply to me to have <em>a lot</em> amongst us, but
I defer giving them a positive answer till it shall please God to bring me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
back to England. In the meanwhile, I have ordered a house to be built,
and some land to be cultivated. If any of my friends will be pleased to
contribute towards carrying on the school for the poor negroes, the bearer
of this, my dear brother Seward, will bring it with him to Georgia.</p>

<p>"<em>He</em> comes to fetch a fellow-labourer to supply my place during my
absence. If he succeeds, you may expect to see me the beginning of next
year; if not, I shall continue in America. I daily receive most importunate
invitations to preach in all the countries round about. God is pleased to
give a great blessing to my <em>printed sermons</em>. They are now in the hands
of thousands in these parts.</p>

<p>"You will not be surprised that there are many adversaries; but, alas!
what are they? <em>Covetous, proud boasters, self-willed blasphemers, having
a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.</em> If I pleased such
men, I should not be a servant of Jesus Christ. What most of all grieves
them is my two letters against Archbishop Tillotson. The first you have
already read; the second I now send you. I abhor controversy and disputation;
but <em>my Master's</em> glory now calls me to be more explicit than I have
been yet. Blessed be His name! many who were before <em>blinded</em> by that
great man, now see; and one of my Savannah parishioners, once a great
favourer of the Archbishop, being lately <em>awakened</em>, sent me seventeen
volumes of the Archbishop's sermons, to be disposed of as I pleased.</p>

<p>"The clergy, I find, are most offended at me. The Commissary of
Philadelphia has denied me the pulpit; and, last Sunday, preached up an
<em>historical faith</em>, and <em>justification by works</em>. The bigotted, <em>self-righteous
Quakers</em> now also begin to spit out a little of the venom of the serpent.
They cannot bear the doctrine of <em>original sin</em> and <em>imputed righteousness</em>
as the cause of our acceptance with God. One of their head teachers
called original sin original nonsense. I have not yet met with much
opposition from the <em>Dissenters</em>; but, when I come to tell many of them,
<em>ministers</em> as well as <em>people</em>, that they <em>hold the truth in unrighteousness</em>&mdash;that
they talk and preach of <em>justifying faith</em>, but never truly <em>felt</em> it in their
hearts, as I am persuaded numbers of them have not,&mdash;then they, no
doubt, will <em>shoot out their arrows, even bitter words</em>. But I am not to
have respect to persons or parties. The more I am opposed, the more
joy I feel."</p></blockquote>

<p>All must lament that Whitefield felt it a duty to be such a
religious Ishmaelite; but, at the same time, all must admire
the man's benevolence, faith, and courage, in sustaining a
family of a hundred persons, by voluntary contributions,
which he confidently expected, but was powerless to command.
It was not braggardism, when Whitefield said, he
had rather depend on God for the support of his orphan
family than on large endowments quite sufficient and absolutely
given for such an object. Whitefield was reverently
treading in the footsteps of Professor Francke, and was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
predecessor of George Muller, and of other praying and
trustful philanthropists of the present day. His scheme for
founding a negro-school, and a refuge for his persecuted
English friends, also displays his large-heartedness; and,
though the scheme was not executed, this was not because it
was utopian, but because William Seward, a few months
afterwards, fell a martyr to his Christian zeal and fidelity.
Seward had determined to give up himself and his fortune
"to assist Whitefield in his generous undertaking;"<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> but the
Divine Ruler ordered it to be otherwise. Whitefield says
he had directed a school for the negroes to be built, and
"some of the five thousand acres of land to be cultivated."
This order seems to have been given to Peter Bohler, whom
he had met at Skippack three days before; and who, with
his Moravian pilgrim band, left their settlement near Savannah,
and immediately set out for the forks of Delaware,
travelling through forests where the white man had never
trod, and imperiling their lives from savage Indians, but all
the way singing the fine hymns of their native land to the
God of all grace for the continued tokens of His care and
blessing. On May 30, Bohler and his friends assembled
under the shadow of a broad black oak: for the first time,
the solitudes of the vast forest echoed with sweet songs of
praise; workmen wielded the axe; carpenters used the saw;
and Bohler conducted daily worship, and encouraged everyone
by his counsels and example. The work proceeded with great
rapidity; but, at length, an order was received from Whitefield,
requiring Bohler and his brethren to abandon the
undertaking; and Bishop Nitschmann requested Bohler's return
to Europe, where his services were urgently demanded.
On January 29, 1741, Bohler obeyed his bishop's summons;
but, before long; Whitefield offered the sale of the land to
the Brethren; and, in 1743, the purchase was completed,
and the Moravian settlement of Nazareth established.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>Whitefield, having written the long letter from which the
foregoing extract is taken, had now to separate from his
devoted friend, William Seward. The latter writes:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"1740. April 28. Had a most affectionate parting with our dear brother
Whitefield, and our other brethren. We fell upon each other's necks and
embraced each other, and wished for that happy time when we shall part
no more; but we must first finish the work given us to do, and then we
may with comfort say, 'Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.'"<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the same day, Whitefield wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Took a sorrowful leave of Captain Gladman, and my dear brother and
fellow-traveller, Mr. Seward, whom I have dispatched to England to bring
me over a fellow-labourer, and to transact several affairs of importance.
Hitherto, Captain Gladman has had the command of our sloop; but I
have now committed the care of it to his mate, whom God was pleased to
bring home to Himself when I was last at Philadelphia."</p></blockquote>

<p>In foot-notes to a subsequent edition of his Journal, Whitefield
adds concerning Seward:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This was the last time I saw my worthy friend; for, before my return
to England, he was entered into his rest;" and, concerning the mate, he
says, "This young man lived with me and served the Orphan House
cheerfully and gratis for several years. Afterwards, he married one of the
orphans, and is now [1756] settled as a merchant in Philadelphia, where
both continue to adorn the gospel of our Lord."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the day he parted with Mr. Seward, Whitefield
proceeded to Woodbridge, where he preached to about two
thousand people, and "dined at the Dissenting minister's
house." Thence, he rode to Elizabeth Town, and preached
"in the meeting-house," to a like congregation, which included
two clergymen and ten Dissenting ministers. The
next day, he arrived at New York, and preached on "the
common, to five or six thousand." During the night, the
people erected him a scaffold, from which, on Wednesday,
April 30, he preached twice, his night congregation numbering
upwards of seven thousand.</p>

<p>At this period, Whitefield's health was feeble; but his
Christian ardour would not permit him to indulge in rest.
On May 1, he went, in the morning, to Long Island, where
"God had lately begun a most glorious work, by the ministry
of two young Presbyterian ministers." Here, the Dutch
ministers gave him the use of their church; and, though
exceedingly unwell, he preached nearly an hour and a half.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
He then hurried back to New York; and, in the evening,
addressed "as large a congregation as ever." On May 2,
he "preached twice in the field, and once in the meeting-house."
On May 4, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sunday. Preached, at seven in the morning, in the meeting-house.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
Went to the English church twice; and preached in the evening to about
eight thousand in the field. After sermon, numbers came to me, giving
God thanks for what they had heard, and brought several large contributions
for my poor orphans. Blessed be God! by public collections and
private donations, I have received upwards of £300 since I came hither."</p></blockquote>

<p>Next day, he left New York, and came to Freehold,
William and Gilbert Tennent meeting him on the way.
On May 6, he preached to about three thousand at Freehold;
rode, in company with many others, sixteen miles to
Allen's Town, where he preached to the same number; and
then went twenty miles farther, to Burlington, where he
arrived at midnight. After a few hours' sleep, he crossed
the ferry into Pennsylvania, preached to four thousand at
Bristol, hurried to Philadelphia, was warmly welcomed by
his "kind host, Mr. Benezet,"<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> and concluded the day by
hearing "Mr. Jones, the Baptist minister, who preached the
truth as it is in Jesus."</p>

<p>This was enormous labour for an enfeebled man. He
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Thursday, May 8. Had what my body much wanted, a thorough
night's repose. Was called up early to speak to those under convictions.
The first who came was an Indian trader,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> whom God was pleased to
bring home by my preaching when here last. He is just come from the
Indian nation, where he has been praying with and exhorting all he met.
He has hopes of some of the Indians; but his fellow-traders endeavoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
to prejudice them against him. However, he proposes to visit them again
in the autumn. Preached, at eleven, to six or seven thousand people, and
cleared myself from some aspersions that had been cast upon my doctrine,
as though it tended to Antinomianism. At five in the evening, I preached
to a rather larger audience; and, afterwards, rode ten miles to a friend's
house, that I might be in readiness to preach, according to appointment
next morning.</p>

<p>"Friday, May 9. Preached at Pennytack, to about two thousand
people; and again, in the evening, at Philadelphia; and afterwards
settled a Society of young men, many of whom, I trust, will prove good
soldiers of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"Saturday, May 10. Preached twice to-day, and to larger congregations
than ever; and, in the evening, settled a Society of young women,
who seemed to be under the strongest convictions, and to be seeking
Jesus sorrowing. Their cries might be heard a great way off.</p>

<p>"Sunday, May 11. Preached to about fifteen thousand people in the
morning. Went twice to church, and heard myself taken to task by the
preacher. In the afternoon, I preached my farewell sermon, to very near
twenty thousand hearers. After I had taken my leave, many visited my
lodgings, amongst whom, I believe, were fifty negroes, who came to tell
me what God had done for their souls. Some of them have been effectually
wrought upon, and in an uncommon manner. Many of them have
begun to learn to read. One, who was free, said she would give me her
two children, whenever I settle my school. I hope masters and mistresses
will see that Christianity will not make their negroes worse slaves. I intended
to have settled a Society for negro men and negro women; but that
must be deferred till it shall please God to bring me to Philadelphia again.
I have been much drawn out in prayer for them, and have seen them
exceedingly wrought upon under the word preached. I cannot well
express how many others, of all sorts, came to give me a last farewell. I
never yet saw a more general awakening in any place. Many of the
Quakers have been convinced of the righteousness of Jesus Christ, and
openly confess the truth as it is in Jesus; for which, I believe, they will
shortly be put out of their synagogues. With preaching, and praying,
and conversing, I was truly weary by eight at night; but I went and baptized
two children, took my leave of both the Societies, and, at my return
home, supped with some Christian friends, and went to bed, desirous to
be humbly thankful for what the Lord had done at Philadelphia.</p>

<p>"Monday, May 12. Rose early to answer those who came for private
advice. Visited three persons, one of whom was under such deep convictions,
that she had taken scarce anything to eat for a fortnight. Another
had a prospect of hell set before her last night in the most terrifying
colours; but, before morning, received comfort. When I came to my
lodgings, my friends were waiting to accompany me on horseback, and
great numbers of the common people were crowding about the door.
About nine, I left Philadelphia, and, when I came to the ferry, was told
that people had been crossing over, as fast as two boats could carry them,
ever since three in the morning. After we had waited some time, I and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
my friends got over, and I preached at Derby, seven miles from Philadelphia
to about four thousand hearers. There I took a sorrowful leave
of many, and then preached at Chester, about nine miles off, to two
thousand; and collected there and at Derby upwards of £40 for the
orphans. Here I parted with more friends; but several went with me to
Wilmington, fifteen miles from Chester. We got in about eleven at night.
My body was weak; but God strengthened me to pray, to sing psalms,
and to exhort a room full of people for about an hour.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, May 13. In the morning, preached at Wilmington to five
thousand; and, at Whiteclay Creek, in the evening, to three thousand.
At both places, we collected about £24 for the Orphan House. After
sermon at Whiteclay Creek, I rode towards Nottingham with Mr.
William Tennent, Mr. Craghead, and Mr. Blair,<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> all worthy ministers of
the Lord Jesus, and with many others belonging to Philadelphia. We
rode through the woods singing, and praising God, and got to a Quaker's
house at midnight.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, May 14. Preached at Nottingham both morning and
evening. It surprised me to see such a multitude gathered together, at
so short a warning, and in such a desert place. I believe there were near
twelve thousand. I had not spoken long, before I perceived numbers
melting. As I proceeded, the influence increased, till, at last, thousands
cried out, so that they almost drowned my voice. I myself was so overpowered
with a sense of God's love, that it almost took away my life. At
length, I revived, and was strengthened to go with Messrs. Blair, Tennent,
and some other friends, to Mr. Blair's house, twenty miles from Nottingham.
In the way, we refreshed our souls by singing psalms and
hymns. We got to our journey's end at midnight.</p>

<p>"Thursday, May 15. Preached at Fagg's Manor, three miles from
Mr. Blair's house. The congregation was about as large as that at
Nottingham. Most of the people were drowned in tears. The word was
sharper than a two-edged sword. The bitter cries and groans were
enough to pierce the hardest heart. Some of the people were as pale as
death; others were wringing their hands; others lying on the ground;
others sinking into the arms of their friends; and most lifting up their
eyes to heaven, and crying to God for mercy. They seemed like persons
awakened by the last trump, and coming out of their graves to judgment.
After dinner, I rode to Newcastle, twenty-four miles from Fagg's Manor,
preached to about four thousand, prayed with several who came many
miles under violent convictions, and then went on board our sloop, the
<em>Savannah</em>."</p></blockquote>

<p>To return, for a moment, to Whitefield in Philadelphia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
His success here was marvellous. Hence the following
letter, published in the <cite>New England Journal</cite>, of June 24,
1740:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Philadelphia, June 12, 1740. During the session of the Presbyterian
Synod, which began here on the 28th of last month, and continued to the
3rd inst., there were no less than fourteen sermons preached on Society
Hill, to large audiences, by the Revs. Messrs. Tennent, Davenport,
Rowland, and Blair; besides what were delivered in the Presbyterian
and Baptist meetings, and expoundings and exhortations in private
houses. The alteration in the face of religion in Philadelphia is surprising.
Never did the people shew so great a willingness to attend sermons,
nor the preachers greater zeal and diligence in performing the duties of
their function. Religion has become the subject of most conversations.
No books are in request, but those of piety and devotion. Instead of
singing idle songs and ballads, the people are everywhere entertaining
themselves with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. All this, under
God, is owing to the successful labours of the Rev. Mr. Whitefield."</p></blockquote>

<p>So much from one of Whitefield's friends. Another
letter, from a foe, condemns the movement, but, in reality,
confirms what has just been said. In the Boston <cite>Post Boy</cite>,
of June 23, 1740, appeared the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Philadelphia, June 5, 1740. Field-preaching prevails with the vulgar
in Philadelphia so much, that industry, honest labour, and care for their
families seem to be held, by many, as sinful, and as a mark that they
neglect the salvation of their souls. Mr. Whitefield and his adherent
ministers have infatuated the multitude with the doctrines of regeneration,
free grace, conversion, etc., representing them as essential articles
of religion, though, in reality, they are inconsistent with true religion,
natural and revealed, and are subversive of all order and decency, and
repugnant to common sense. Every day we have instances of the
melancholy fruits of these sermons. Many, of weak minds, are terrified
into despair, by the threatenings of eternal vengeance. Some are so
transported with the passions which influence them, that they believe
they have had the beatific vision, and immediate intercourse with Him
who is invisible.</p>

<p>"I have informed you of all this, because Mr. Whitefield intends to
visit Boston in the autumn, where, I understand, he is impatiently waited
for. I wish his ministry there may not be attended with the same bad
effects, as here, by diverting and disturbing the labouring people, who
are generally too much inclined to novelties, especially in point of religion.
Mr. Whitefield is the more to be guarded against, because, I
can assure you, he is qualified to sway and keep the affections of the
multitude."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the day this caution was written, Whitefield, after an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
absence of nine weeks, arrived in his parish of Savannah.
In his wanderings he had collected nearly £500 sterling
for his orphans, and was taking home with him a
bricklayer, a tailor, two maidservants, and two little girls,
the last mentioned being the children of the man who
had kept the dancing school, and the assembly and
concert room in Philadelphia.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Whitefield could not be
idle. The wind being contrary, he went on shore at Reedy
Island three days in succession, and preached to such
congregations as could be gathered. For the same reason,
he also spent two days at Lewis Town, during which he
read prayers and preached thrice in the English Church,
and likewise addressed two crowds from a balcony out
of doors, the church not being capable of holding them.
His leisure hours he employed in writing letters to his
friends. The following was addressed to William Seward,
who had recently gone as his envoy to England:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Reedy Island</span>, <em>May 19, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,&mdash;The war between Michael and the dragon
has much increased since you left. Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> has preached most of
his people away from him. He lashed me most bravely the Sunday
before I came away. Mr. A&mdash;&mdash; also preaches against me; and Mr.
J&mdash;&mdash; is very inveterate. At New York, the word ran. Twice or thrice
our Lord appeared for us in a glorious manner. Mr. Tennent and his
brethren glow with divine warmth. Last week, at Nottingham, and at
Mr. Blair's, how did God manifest His glory! We had about twelve
thousand hearers; and such a melting, such a crying, was scarcely ever
seen. Blessed be God! the devil's children begin to throw off the mask.
At Philadelphia, affairs go on better and better; only Satan now begins to
throw many into fits. I have generally preached twice, and ridden nearly
thirty miles a day since your departure. I believe the work will go on
better here than in England. We are more united in our principles, and
do not print one against another. We are now at Reedy Island, waiting
for the wind. I heard of a ship going to Dublin, and could not lose the
opportunity of writing to my dear brother Seward. I need not remind
you to hasten over as fast as possible. Our Lord has taught you not to
stay by the way. I am somewhat better as to bodily health. My Master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
never fails me. Oh exhort all to fall in love with Jesus, and to pray for,
ever yours, in the best of bonds,</p>

<p>The next was to an "Indian trader," and is full of good
advice to a young missionary to the heathen:&mdash;</p>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Reedy Island</span>, <em>May 19, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"I received your letter, and have been reading part of your journal. I
think it your bounden duty to go amongst the Indians again, not as a
<em>minister</em>, but as a private Christian, whose duty it is, when converted
himself, to strengthen his brethren. An effectual door, I hope, is opening
amongst some of the heathen. It is plain God calls you, and I wish you
good success in the name of the Lord. Be sure you keep a close walk
with God. Be much in prayer; and prepare for hardships. Your
greatest perils will be amongst your own countrymen; but the Lord
Jesus will make you more than conqueror. The word of the Lord will
make its own way. Beg of God to give you true notions of our free justification
by faith in Jesus Christ. Bring your Indian hearers to believe,
before you talk of baptism or the supper of the Lord. Otherwise they
will catch at a shadow and neglect the substance. Improve the leisure
you now enjoy, and see that you feel the truths you speak. Feed on this
promise, 'It shall be given you in that hour what you shall say.' Your
circumstances call for a fulfilling of it. Tell them what God has been
doing here, and how happy Jesus Christ will make them. Be sure to tell
them, that true faith is not merely in the head, but in the heart, and that
it certainly will be productive of good works. Frequently meditate on
God's free love to yourself. That will best qualify you to speak of it
affectionately to others. I could say more, but time will not permit.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Honoured Sir</span>,&mdash;I cannot entertain prejudices against your conduct
and principles any longer, without informing you. The more I examine
the writings of the most experienced men, and the experiences of the most
established Christians, the more I differ from your notion about not committing
sin, and your denying the doctrines of election and final perseverance
of the saints. I dread coming to England, unless you are resolved
to oppose these truths with less warmth, than when I was there last. I
dread your coming to America, because the work of God is carried on here
(and that in a most glorious manner) by doctrines quite opposite to those
you hold. Here are thousands of God's children, who will not be persuaded
out of the privileges purchased for them by the blood of Jesus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
Here are many worthy experienced ministers, who would oppose your
principles to the utmost. God direct me what to do! Sometimes I
think it best to stay here, where we all think and speak the same thing.
The work goes on without divisions, and with more success, because all
employed in it are of one mind.</p>

<p>"I write not this, honoured sir, from heat of spirit, but out of love.
At present, I think you are entirely inconsistent with yourself; and,
therefore, do not blame me, if I do not approve of all you say. From my
soul, I wish you abundant success. I long to hear of your being a
spiritual father to thousands. Perhaps I may never see you again, till we
meet in judgment. Then, if not before, you will know that sovereign,
distinguishing, irresistible grace brought you to heaven. Then will you
know that God loved you with an everlasting love, and, therefore, with
loving-kindness did He draw you.</p>

<p>"Honoured sir, farewell! My prayers constantly attend both you and
your labours. My next journal will acquaint you with new and surprising
wonders. I am supported, under the prospect of impending trials, with
an assurance of God's loving me to the end; yea, even to all eternity.
Ere this reaches you, I suppose you will hear of my intention to marry.
I am quite as free as a child. If it be God's will, I beseech Him to
prevent it. I would not be hindered in my dear Lord's business for the
world. God blesses the Orphan House. Do not be angry with, but pray
for, honoured sir, your unworthy brother and servant in Christ,</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>The doctrinal views of the two friends were different;
but they were as loving and faithful to each other as they
had ever been. The controversy between them will frequently
recur.</p>

<p>When Whitefield arrived at Savannah, on the 5th of June,
he was most warmly welcomed by his family and friends,
and was soon rejoiced by the prosperity of the work of
God. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Savannah, Friday, June 6. Blessed be the God of all grace, who
continues to do for us marvellous things! This afternoon, one of the men
that I brought over was enabled to wrestle with God exceedingly, both
for himself and others. After this, I went up and prayed for near half an
hour with some of the women of the house and three girls, who seemed to
be weary with the weight of their sins. When we came to public worship,
young and old were all dissolved in tears. After service, several of my
parishioners, all my family, and the little children, returned home crying
along the streets, and some could not avoid praying very loud."</p></blockquote>

<p>The next day, Whitefield wrote to James Hutton, the
London Moravian, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Savannah</span>, <em>June 7, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear, dear Brother</span>,&mdash;With great comfort, I received your long
wished-for letter. Let all former misunderstandings between me and
your friends be entirely forgotten. I always pitied your parents, and
most earnestly prayed for them and you.</p>

<p>"O what wonderful things is God doing in America! Savannah also,
<em>my dear Savannah</em>, especially my little orphans, now begin to feel the
love of Jesus Christ. I arrived here two days ago, in an hour quite
unexpected by my friends. How did we weep over one another for joy!
Perhaps I may never feel the like again, till I meet the sons of God in
glory. I prayed with three of the girls before I went to church, and I
prayed also with my other dear friends. When we came to church, the
power of the Lord came upon all. Most of the children, both boys and
girls, cried bitterly. The congregation were drowned in tears. When
I came home, I went to prayer again. It would have charmed your
heart to have heard the little ones, in different parts of the house, begging
Jesus to take full possession of their hearts. The same power continues
to-day. For near two hours, four or five of the girls have been before the
Lord weeping most bitterly. God blesses me in everything I undertake.
Our Orphan House comes under better regulations every day, and I am
persuaded will produce some true followers of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"My dear brother, may the Lord be with you! For Christ's sake,
desire brother Wesley to avoid disputing with me. I think I had rather
die, than see a division between us; and yet, how can we walk together,
if we oppose each other? Adieu! Dear James, with much tenderness, I
subscribe myself ever yours,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield.</span>"
</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield was in a sort of amazed and wondering ecstasy.
Six days later he wrote the following to a minister at New
York:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Savannah</span>, <em>June 13, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and dear Brother</span>,&mdash;Many of the dear children of
God are too apt to confine God to this or that particular way of acting;
whereas He is a sovereign agent, and His sacred Spirit bloweth when, and
where, and how it listeth. When an uncommon work is to be done, no
doubt, He will work upon His chosen instruments in an uncommon
manner. What the event of the present general awakening will be, I
know not. I desire to follow my dear Lord blindfold, whithersoever He
is pleased to lead me.</p>

<p>"Wonderful things have been done ever since my arrival at Savannah.
Such an awakening among little children, I never saw before. Oh, my
dear brother, how ought such manifestations of God's glory to quicken our
souls, and excite us to lay ourselves out more and more in the service of
the best of masters, Jesus Christ! Every day, He fills me with Himself,
and sometimes brings me upon the confines of eternity. Methinks, I often
stand upon Mount Pisgah, and take a view of the heavenly Canaan, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
then long to be gathered to my people. But my work is scarce begun.
My trials are yet to come. What is a little scourge of the tongue? what
is a thrusting out of the synagogues? The time of temptation will be
when we are thrust into an inner prison. But, 'if Thou, O dearest
Redeemer, wilt strengthen me in the inner man, let enemies plunge me
into a fiery furnace, or throw me into a den of lions!' In the meanwhile
let us all keep a close walk with Jesus.</p>

<p class="sig">
"I am, etc.,<br />
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Towards the end of the month, Whitefield visited the
settlement of the Saltzburgh refugees, at Ebenezer. He
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Wednesday, June 25. Went on Monday to Ebenezer, and returned
to Savannah this evening. Surely there is a difference, even in this life,
between those who serve the Lord, and those who serve Him not. All
other places of the colony seem to be like Egypt, where was darkness, but
Ebenezer, like the land of Goshen, wherein was great light. I walked near
four miles in almost one continued field, covered with a most plentiful crop
of corn, pease, potatoes, etc., all the product of a few months' labour. But
God gives the labourers a peculiar blessing. They are unanimous, and
the strong help the weak. I had sweet communication with their
ministers. Our sister Orphan House there is blessed by their means;
and yesterday was set apart as a day of thanksgiving for some assistance,
lately sent the little ones, from Germany and Savannah.</p></blockquote>

<p>At this period, Philip Henry Molther, the Moravian
preacher, was occasioning great excitement in the meetings
bf the Brethren in London. Molther's views of the means
of grace were, to say the least, extremely confused and
foggy. Both the Wesleys felt it their duty to expose his
heresy. Charles writes:&mdash;"A new commandment, called
'<em>stillness</em>,' has repealed all God's commandments, and
given a full indulgence to corrupted nature." There were
also disputes respecting a fitness to believe in Christ, and
other matters, which it is needless to refer to here.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> While
the contention was proceeding, James Hutton wrote to
Whitefield on the subject; and Whitefield's reply is too
valuable, and too appropriate to the state of things at the
present day, to be omitted.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Savannah</span>, <em>June 25, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dearest James</span>,&mdash;Your last letter I received on Saturday. Blessed
be God, that our friends preach up poverty of spirit, for that is the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
foundation whereon to build solid abiding comfort. The stony ground
received the word with joy; but how did those hearers stand in the day
of temptation? It is very possible that the heart may have much joy
floating on the top of it, and yet be as hard as the nether millstone. Hence
it is that so many, who boast of rest in their flashes of joy, are self-willed,
impatient of reproof, despisers of others in a mourning state, and wise in
their own conceits. The believer who has a truly broken and contrite
heart hangs upon God, and thinks before he speaks. This is the state which
I want all our friends to arrive at. How can they stand, who never felt
themselves condemned criminals? who were never truly burdened with a
sense, not only of their actual but of original sin, especially the damning
sin of unbelief? who were never brought to see and heartily confess, that
after they had done all, God might, notwithstanding, deny them mercy;
and that it is owing solely to His sovereign love in Christ Jesus that we
can have any hopes of being delivered from the wrath to come?</p>

<p>"For preaching in this manner, I like Messrs. Tennents. They wound
deep before they heal. They know that there is no promise made but to
him that believeth; and, therefore, they are careful not to comfort over-much
those who are convicted. I fear I have been too incautious in this
respect, and have often given comfort too soon. The Lord pardon me
for what is past, and teach me more rightly to divide the word of truth for
the future!</p>

<p>One of the clerical friends of Whitefield and of the two
Wesleys was the Rev. George Stonehouse, Vicar of Islington,
who sold his living, and became a Moravian. The following
letter was addressed to him:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Savannah</span>, <em>June 26, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Rev. and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;And is one of the priests also obedient to
the word? Blessed be God! who has translated you from darkness to
light. He seems to be thrusting out more labourers into the harvest.
Glory be to His free grace that you are one of the happy number! Oh,
dear sir, rejoice and be exceeding glad. Let the love of Jesus constrain
you to go out into the highways and hedges to compel poor sinners to
come in. Some may say, 'This is not proceeding with a zeal according
to knowledge;' but I am persuaded, when the power of religion revives,
the gospel must be propagated in the same manner as it was first established,
by <em>itinerant preaching</em>. Go on, dear sir, go on, and follow your
glorious Master without the camp, bearing His reproach. Never fear the
scourge of the tongue, or the threatenings that are daily breathed out
against the Lord, and against His Christ. Suffer we must. Ere long,
perhaps, we may sing in a prison, and have our feet fast in the stocks;
but faith in Jesus turns a prison into a palace, and makes a bed of flames
become a bed of down. Let us be faithful to-day, and our Lord will
support us to-morrow.</p>

<p>An extract of a letter to another Moravian, William
Delamotte, will help to illustrate Whitefield's religious experience
and ecstasies.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,&mdash;I have abundant reason to bless God for
sending me abroad. I cannot say, I have improved my retirement as I
ought; but I can say, it has been highly beneficial to my soul. I have a
garden near at hand, where I go to meet and talk with my God, at the
cool of every day. I often sit in silence, offering my soul, as so much
clay, to be stamped just as my heavenly potter pleases; and, whilst I am
musing, I am often filled, as it were, with the fulness of God. I am frequently
at Calvary, and frequently on Mount Tabor; but always assured
of my Lord's everlasting love. Oh, continue to pray for me. I want to
have a proper mixture of the lion and the lamb, of the serpent and the
dove. I do not despair of attaining it. Jesus is love; Jesus willeth my
perfection; Jesus hath died for me; Jesus can deny me nothing. He
has given me Himself; will He not then freely give me all things besides?
I wait for Thy complete salvation, O Lord! O grace, grace! O Jesu!
Jesu! Was there ever love like Thine? Lord, I abhor myself in dust

<p>The following, addressed to Wesley, refers, not only to
Calvinian disputes, but, to the action which Wesley had

in your sermons. No one can say that I ever mentioned it in public discourses,
whatever my private sentiments may be. For Christ's sake, let
us not be divided amongst ourselves. Nothing will so much prevent a
division as your being silent on this head.</p>

<p>It is difficult to define the position which Whitefield now
occupied. He was a clergyman of the Church of England,
and Savannah was his parish. He had been eight months
in America; but he had spent far more time in preaching
for Dissenters, and in the open air, than he had spent in
his own parochial church.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> He had also practised other
ecclesiastical irregularities. Mr. Stephens, in his "Journal
of the Proceedings in Georgia," writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1740, June 22. Mr. Whitefield always prays and preaches extempore.
For some time past he has laid aside his surplice; and has
managed to get justification by faith, and the new birth, into every
sermon.</p>

<p>"June 30. Mr. Whitefield went off to Carolina, and appointed Mr.
Habersham to read prayers and sermons during his absence. When he
returned, a Mr. Tilly, an Anabaptist teacher, came with him, and preached
and expounded several times in his church."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, Whitefield knew that all this was ecclesiastically
wrong; and it is not surprising that he expected,
what he considered to be, persecution. His previsions were
soon realised. He again left his parish, Savannah, on
June 30, and arrived at Charleston on July 2. In his
Journal he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sunday, July 6. Charleston. Preached twice yesterday, and twice
to-day, and had great reason to believe our Lord got Himself the victory
in some hearts. Went to church in the morning and afternoon, and
heard the commissary preach as virulent, unorthodox, and inconsistent
a discourse as ever I heard in my life. His heart seemed full of choler and
resentment; and, out of the abundance thereof, he poured forth so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
bitter words against the Methodists in general, and me in particular, that
several, who intended to receive the sacrament at his hands, withdrew.
Never, I believe, was such a preparation sermon preached before. I could
not help thinking the preacher was of the same spirit as Bishop Gardner in
Queen Mary's days. After the sermon, he sent his clerk to desire me not
to come to the sacrament, till he had spoken with me. I immediately
retired to my lodging, rejoicing that I was accounted worthy to suffer this
further degree of contempt for my dear Lord's sake. Blessed Jesus, lay
it not to the commissary's charge! Amen and Amen!"</p></blockquote>

<p>The commissary was angry, too angry, perhaps, to be
prudent and dignified. At all events, on the next day, he
issued the following formidable document:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hanging">
"Alexander Garden, lawfully constituted Commissary of the Right
Reverend Father in Christ, Edmund, by Divine permission, Lord
Bishop of London, supported by the Royal authority underwritten.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Alexander Garden</span>,</p>

<p>"To all and singular Clerks and literate persons whomsoever, in
and throughout the whole Province of South Carolina, wheresoever
appointed, greeting; to you conjunctly and severally, we commit, and,
strictly enjoining, command that you do cite, or cause to be cited,
peremptorily, George Whitefield, Clerk and Presbyter of the Church of
England, that he lawfully appear before us, in the Parish Church of St.
Philip's, Charleston, and in the judicial place of the same, on Tuesday,
the fifteenth day of this instant July, betwixt the hours of nine and ten in
the forenoon, then and there in justice to answer certain articles, heads,
or interrogatories, which will be objected and ministered unto him concerning
the mere health of his soul, and reformation and correction of his
manners and excesses, and chiefly for omitting to use the Form of Prayers
prescribed in the Communion Book. And further to do and receive what
shall be just in that behalf, on pain of law and contempt. And what you
shall do in the premises, you shall duly certify us, together with these
presents.</p>

<p>"Given under our hands, and seals of our office, at Charleston, this
seventh day of July, in the year of our Lord, one thousand seven hundred
and forty."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the morning of the day in which this curious document
was published, Whitefield "went to the house of one Mr.
Chandler,<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> a gracious Baptist minister, about fourteen miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
from Charleston, and, according to appointment, preached
in his meeting-house." The next day, he "hastened to
Dorchester, and preached twice in Mr. Osgood's<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> meeting-house,
a young but worthy Independent minister." The
following evening, July 9, he "preached under a tree near
Mr. C.'s meeting-house," the congregation being too large to
be accommodated in the building. He then rode to Charleston,
and "preached, about six in the evening, in the usual
place." On Thursday, July 10, he "went over the water,
and read prayers and preached, at the request of the churchwardens
and vestry, in Christ's Church." On Friday, he
preached twice in Charleston, and received, from the
commissary, by the hands of his apparitor, the following
citation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You are hereby cited to appear at the Church of St. Philip's, Charleston,
on Tuesday the fifteenth day of this instant July, betwixt the hours
of nine and ten in the forenoon, before the Reverend Alexander Garden,
Commissary, to answer to such articles as shall there be objected to you.</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">William Smith</span>, Apparitor."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield had thus four days' notice to answer questions
and accusations, not specified, and concerning which
he could only form conjectures. How did he spend the
interval?</p>

<p>On Saturday, July 12, he went to John's Island, about
twenty miles up the river, and read prayers and preached
twice, in the church. On Sunday, July 13, he preached,
morning and evening, in Charleston; and, in the forenoon,
went to church, and heard Commissary Garden preach, or
rather rave. Whitefield writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Had some infernal spirit been sent to draw my picture, I think it
scarcely possible that he could have painted me in more horrid colours.
I think, if ever, then was the time that all manner of evil was spoken
against me falsely for Christ's sake. The commissary seemed to ransack
church history for instances of enthusiasm and abused grace. He drew
a parallel between me and all the <em>Oliverians</em>, <em>Ranters</em>, <em>Quakers</em>, and
<em>French Prophets</em>, till he came down to a family of the <em>Dutarts</em>, who lived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
not many years ago, in South Carolina, and were guilty of the most
notorious incests and murders. To the honour of God's free grace be it
spoken, whilst the commissary was representing me thus, I felt the blessed
Spirit strengthening and refreshing my soul. God, at the same time,
gave me to see what I was by nature, and how I had deserved His eternal
wrath; and, therefore, I did not feel the least resentment against the
preacher. No; I pitied, I prayed for him; and wished, from my soul,
that the Lord would convert him, as He once did the persecutor Saul."</p></blockquote>

<p>Notwithstanding this violent outpouring, from Whitefield's
ecclesiastical accuser and judge, only forty-eight hours before
the trial was to take place, Whitefield, on the following day,
again preached twice in Charleston, as though nought had
happened.</p>

<p>The next day, July 15, the court assembled at St. Philip's
Church, and consisted of the commissary, and the Rev.
Messrs. Guy, Millichamp, Roe, and Orr.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> The spectators, of
course, were numerous. First of all, the commissary handed
Whitefield a paper, containing a list of the accusations against
him, and which he was desired to answer. Whitefield
refused to answer, until he was satisfied concerning the
authority of the court to examine him. The commissary
said, "They would proceed to censure him." Whitefield
reminded his judges of the example of the heathen magistrates,
who exceeded their authority in condemning St. Paul
unheard. Mr. Garden then sent his apparitor for his
commission, from the Bishop of London, to act as commissary.
Whitefield examined it, and objected that the
Royal authority was not underwritten. Upon this, a Latin
commission without a seal was read. Whitefield replied, that,
though there might be a <em>general power</em> given the bishop to
exercise ecclesiastical jurisdiction in that province, yet the
extent of that jurisdiction was to be determined by <em>particular</em>
Acts of Assembly. And, further, that he belonged to Georgia,
a different province, and was in South Carolina only as an
itinerant. He also added, that, though he had preached in
the fields near London, the bishop had never attempted
to exercise such authority over him; and that the Trustees
of Georgia, to his knowledge, doubted whether the Bishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
of London had any jurisdiction in the transatlantic
colonies. He, therefore, requested that he might have till
to-morrow morning, to inform himself of the extent of jurisdiction
of the commissary's court in South Carolina. The
request was grudgingly granted; and, leaving the court,
Whitefield concluded the day by preaching twice in Charleston.</p>

<p>Next morning, July 16, Whitefield, by the advice of his
friends, presented an <em>exception</em> against Garden acting as his
judge, because he had reason to believe he was prejudiced
against him. The commissary read the <em>exception</em>, and refused
to accept it. Whitefield protested against all further proceedings,
as null and void; and left the court. Being
recalled by the apparitor and registrar, he returned, and
handed in his <em>exception</em> to be read and filed. Mr. Graham,
the commissary's attorney, insisted upon having the <em>exception</em>
tried in court; but, as Whitefield had referred it to the
examination of six arbitrators (three to be nominated
by him, and three by the commissary), Mr. Rutledge,
Whitefield's attorney, protested against all further proceedings,
and against Whitefield having to appear in court again,
until the arbitrators had met, and come to an agreement.
Such were the proceedings of the second day. On leaving
the court, Whitefield went to James' Island, and read prayers
and preached.</p>

<p>On the day following, Whitefield appeared again before
his self-constituted judges, and asked if his <em>exception</em> was to
be referred to arbitration, or to be repelled? Being told
that the <em>exception</em> was repelled, he then lodged an appeal to
his Majesty in the High Court of Chancery; and went
again to James' Island, and preached in Madam Woodward's
barn.</p>

<p>Nothing remarkable occurred during the next three days,
except that the irrepressible evangelist preached twice every
day in Charleston; and that, on Saturday afternoon, the
apparitor again brought him before the commissary, to take
an oath that he would lodge his appeal within a twelvemonth,
and deposit £10 sterling as a guarantee that his oath would
be fulfilled. Finding that the commissary had authority to
require this, the oath was taken, and the £10 deposited.</p>

<p>Thus ended the first trial in the first Episcopal Court in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
the British Colonies.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Appealing to the High Court of
Chancery was an expensive business; but Whitefield did
appeal. It so happened, however, that the hearing of his
appeal was so deferred as to give the ecclesiastical judge of
Charleston a new opportunity to vent his anger. For a
year and a day, all proceedings in Commissary Garden's
court were stayed; but, at the expiration of that time, Whitefield
was again summoned to attend before his Charleston
judges; and, as he neither appeared nor put in an answer,
the following decree was pronounced against him. After
reciting that his frequently preaching in Dissenting meeting-houses,
without using the forms of prayer prescribed by the
Book of Common Prayer, had been proved by Hugh Anderson,
Stephen Hartley, and John Redman, the decree, in a cloud
of high-sounding words, continued,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Therefore we, Alexander Garden, the Judge aforesaid, having first
invoked the name of Christ, and setting and having God Himself alone
before our eyes, and by and with the advice of the Reverend persons,
William Guy, Timothy Millichamp, Stephen Roe, and William Orr, with
whom in that part we have advised and maturely deliberated, do pronounce,
decree, and declare the aforesaid George Whitefield, clerk, to
have been at the times articled, and now to be a priest of the Church of
England, and at the times and days in that part articled to have officiated
as a minister in divers meeting-houses in Charleston, in the province of
South Carolina, by praying and preaching to public congregations; and
at such times to have omitted to use the Form of Prayer prescribed in the
Communion Book, or Book of Common Prayer; or at least according to
the laws, canons, and constitutions ecclesiastical in that part made, provided,
and promulged, not to have used the same according to the lawful
proofs before us in that part judicially had and made. We, therefore,
pronounce, decree, and declare that the said George Whitefield, for his
excesses and faults, ought, duly and canonically, and according to the
exigence of the law in that part of the premises, to be corrected and
punished, and also to be suspended from his office; and, accordingly, by
these presents, we do suspend him, the said George Whitefield; and, for
being so suspended, we also pronounce, decree, and declare him to
be denounced, declared, and published openly and publicly in the face
of the Church."<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As to how far the proceedings of this petty court of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
colonial clergymen, and their high-flown decree, were legal,
I am not able to express an opinion; but it is scarcely
possible to repress a smile at the official pomposity of
Whitefield's judges. How was Whitefield himself affected?
Writing to a friend four days before the trial commenced, he
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"July 11, 1740. I have been at Charleston a week. The Lord has
been pleased to work on many hearts. On Sunday, the commissary denied
me the sacrament; but, my dear Master fed me, notwithstanding, with
the bread which cometh down from heaven. Persecution seems to be
coming on more and more. On Tuesday, I am cited to appear before
the commissary and his court in a judicial way. I leave the event to my
Lord Jesus. If we suffer, we shall reign with Him."</p></blockquote>

<p>To other friends, the day after the trial was concluded,
Whitefield wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Praise the Lord, O my soul! Our glorious Emmanuel seems to have
girded His sword upon His thigh, and to be riding on from conquering to
conquer. He is getting Himself the victory in Charleston. A glorious
work is begun here. Many souls are awakened. The alteration in the
people, since I came here at first, is surprising. I preach twice a day
generally, either in the town or in the villages around. The commissary
shoots out his arrows, even bitter words. He has denied me the sacrament,
and cited me to appear before him and his court. I was obliged to
appeal home. Oh, my dear brother, pray that I may be humble, and of a
childlike spirit. Every day God shews me fresh instances of His love.
There are some faithful ministers among the Baptists.</p>

<p>"God seems to be carrying on as great a work in Charleston as in
Philadelphia. Surely our Lord intends to set the world in a flame. O
that the holy fire of His divine love were kindled in every heart! Do not
let us forsake Him, though we live in a crooked and perverse generation.
Last night, I appeared a third time in a public court; but they did not
accept my <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">recusatio judicis</i>, and I appealed home; so that now I have
free liberty to embark when Providence pleaseth.</p>

<p>"God will work, and who shall hinder? The commissary's detaining
me here, has much tended to the furtherance of the gospel. I put in my
<em>exception</em> against his sitting as my judge, and it was repelled; so that I
have appealed home, and all other proceedings here are stopped. By
this means, I shall have liberty to preach the gospel without further interruption,
and my call to England will be more clear. The Philadelphia
people are building a house for me, one hundred and six feet long and
seventy-four wide. The Lord is bringing mighty things to pass. The
inhabitants here are wondrous kind. We often see the stately steps of
our dear Lord in His sanctuary. I am more than happy. I am amazed
at the Divine goodness. Lord, I abhor myself in dust and ashes! See<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
the wonders of the Lord. Help us to praise Him. O pray that an
humble, childlike spirit may be given to ever yours in Christ,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Appropriately might Whitefield have applied to himself
the words of St. Paul: "We are troubled on every side, yet
not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted,
but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed."
His success in Charleston had been marvellous. He
wrote:<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At my first coming, the people of Charleston seemed to be wholly
devoted to pleasure. One, well acquainted with their manners and circumstances,
told me that they spent more on their polite entertainments
than the amount raised by their rates for the poor. But now the jewellers
and dancing-masters begin to cry out that their craft is in danger. A vast
alteration is discernible in ladies' dresses; and some, while I have been
speaking, have been so convinced of the sin of wearing jewels, that, I
have seen them, with blushes, put their hands to their ears, and cover
them with their fans. The reformation, also, has gone further than
externals. Many moral, good sort of men, who before were settled on
their lees, have been awakened to seek after Jesus Christ; and many a
Lydia's heart has been opened to receive the things that were spoken.
Indeed, the word came like a hammer and a fire. Several of the negroes
did their work in less time than usual, that they might come to hear
me; and many of their owners, who have been awakened, have resolved
to teach them Christianity. Had I time and proper schoolmasters, I
might immediately erect a negro school in South Carolina, as well as in
Pennsylvania. Many would willingly contribute both money and land."</p></blockquote>

<p>This was the man whom Commissary Garden wished to
silence. His effort was a futile one. As jubilant as ever,
Whitefield, on July 24, set sail for Savannah, where, though
seriously unwell, on Sunday, August 3, at the almost imperative
request of several friends who had come a great
distance to hear him, he <em>tried</em> to preach. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Before I had prayed long, Mr. B. dropped down, as though shot with
a gun. The influence spread. The greatest part of the congregation
were under great concern. Tears trickled down apace, and God comforted
us much at the sacrament."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the following Sunday, he expounded, as usual, early
in the morning; "and read part of the prayers at ten
o'clock, but got Mr. Tilly, a Baptist minister, to preach."
The Rev. Mr. Jones, of Port Royal, officiated for him in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
afternoon; and the day was concluded with the following
scene in Whitefield's house. He says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I began to speak to my friends around me of the things of God. A
great alteration was discernible in most of the company, and many burst
into tears. Ere I had done, some of my parishioners came up, and joined
with the rest of my family. I was enabled to wrestle with God in their
behalf. The room was filled with cries, and many sought Jesus sorrowing.
Several were in great agonies of soul, and a Cherokee Indian trader,
who was present, said he never saw or felt the like before."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield spent a third Sunday, August 17, with his
parishioners, at the close of which, he went on board his
sloop, and was absent for the next four months. Before
following him, two or three extracts from his letters may
be useful. To Mr. Noble, of New York, he wrote as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Savannah</span>, <em>August 15, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"God has been pleased to bring me low, by inward weakness and
faintness of spirits. I have sometimes been kept from preaching; but,
when I have spoken, the word has come with power. A serious, lively
Baptist minister, named Tilly, is here. He has preached often for me;
and, last Sunday, received the sacrament in our way. O bigotry, thou
art tumbling down apace! Blessed be God! Next week, God willing, I
embark for Charleston, and from thence purpose going to New England.
God wonderfully provides for my orphans. I am kept from every degree
of doubting."</p></blockquote>

<p>To his mother he addressed the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Charleston</span>, <em>August 22, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"Every day I love and honour you more and more; and, when you come
to judgment, God will shew you how many tears I have shed in secret
for you, and for my dear sister. Honoured mother, flee to Jesus. Behold,
with open arms, yonder He stands ready to embrace you, if you feel
your misery, and are willing to come to Him to find rest. For near six
weeks past, I have been under great weakness of body. I am now somewhat
better; but, without a miracle, cannot think of being long below.
Every day I long to be dissolved and to be with Christ."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield's correspondence with Wesley was chiefly on
the doctrines of election and final perseverance. The
ensuing is too characteristic to be omitted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Charleston</span>, <em>August 25, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"Dear and honoured Sir,&mdash;Last night I had the pleasure of receiving
an extract from your Journal.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> This morning I read it. I pray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
God to give it His blessing. Many things, I trust, will prove beneficial,
especially the account of yourself. Only, give me leave, with all humility,
to exhort you not to be strenuous in opposing the doctrines of election
and final perseverance, when, by your own confession,<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> 'you have not the
witness of the Spirit within yourself,' and, consequently, are not a proper
judge. I remember dear brother E&mdash;&mdash; told me one day, that he was 'convinced
of the perseverance of the saints.' I told him, you were not. He
replied, 'But he will be convinced when he has got the Spirit himself.'
For some years, God has given me this living witness in my soul. I have
not, since then, indulged any doubts (at least, for no considerable time),
about the forgiveness of my sins. Nay, I can scarce say that I have ever
doubted at all. When I have been nearest death, my evidences have
been the clearest. I have been on the borders of Canaan, and do every
day long for the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ; not to evade sufferings,
but with a single desire to see His blessed face.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the doctrines of election and final perseverance have been
abused; but, notwithstanding, they are children's bread, and ought not
to be withheld from them, supposing they are always mentioned with
proper cautions against the abuse.</p>

<p>"Dear and honoured sir, I write not this to enter into disputation.
I hope I feel something of the meekness and gentleness of Christ. I
cannot bear the thought of opposing you; but how can I avoid it, if you
go about, as your brother Charles once said, to drive John Calvin out of
Bristol? Alas! I never read anything that Calvin wrote. My doctrines
I had from Christ and His apostles. I was taught them of God; and, as
God was pleased to send me out first, and to enlighten me first, so I
think He still continues to do it. My business seems to be chiefly in
planting; if God send you to water, I praise His name. I wish you a
thousandfold increase.</p>

<p>"I find, by young Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;'s letter, there is disputing among you
about election and perfection. I pray God to put a stop to it; for what
good end will it answer? I wish I knew your principles fully. If you
were to write oftener, and more frankly, it might have a better effect than
silence and reserve.</p>

<p>"I have lately had many domestic trials, and that about points of doctrine,
not from myself, but from others in my absence. I daily wait upon
God, depending on His promise, that all things, even this, shall work
together for my good. Many in Charleston, I believe, are called of God.
You may now find a Christian, without searching the town as with a candle.
Mr. Garden is less furious, at least in public. He has expended all his
strength, and finds he cannot prevail.</p>

<p>"Adieu! honoured sir, adieu! With almost tears of love to you and
the brethren, do I subscribe myself,</p>

<p class="sig">
"Your most affectionate brother and servant in Christ,<br />

"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>Commissary Garden had done his utmost to silence the
young evangelist, but had failed. Whitefield arrived again
in Charleston on August 21; and, though in feeble health,
he preached, during his brief sojourn, once every day, and
twice on Sundays. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The audiences were more numerous than ever. It was supposed that
not less than four thousand were in and about the meeting-house, when I
preached my farewell sermon. Being denied the sacrament at church, I
administered it thrice in a private house; namely, yesterday, yesterday
seven-night, and this morning. Never did I see anything more
solemn. The room was large, and most of the communicants were dissolved
in tears. Surely Jesus Christ was evidently set forth before us.
Baptists, Churchmen, and Presbyterians, all joined together, and received
according to the Church of England, excepting two, who desired to have
it sitting. I willingly complied, knowing it was a thing quite indifferent."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course all this was scandalous in the eyes of Mr.
Garden; but to keep Whitefield within the grooves of
church order was impossible. Having, for the present,
finished his work at Charleston, he again embarked, and
proceeded to Rhode Island. During the voyage, he wrote
the following letter to "The Right Reverend Father in God,
Edmund Lord Bishop of London."</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">On board the Savannah</span>, <em>September, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;Although your lordship has been pleased to caution the
people against running into those extremes, to which your lordship apprehended
my doctrine would lead men; yet I am persuaded that will not
any way influence your lordship as to the contents of this letter. The
one single point which it contains, is this query, Whether the commissary
of South Carolina has power given him, from your lordship, to exercise
any <em>judicial</em> authority against me, or against any other clergyman, who
does not belong to his province?</p>

<p>"The reason of my putting this question, I suppose, your lordship will
be apprised of, before this reaches your lordship's hands. I have been
lately cited to appear in an ecclesiastical court, erected by the Rev. Mr.
Garden, for not reading the Common Prayer in the meeting-house, which,
unless I would be silent, I was obliged to preach in at Charleston, because
the commissary would not let me have the use of his church. I appeared;
and have appealed, according to law, to four of His Majesty's commissioners
for reviewing appeals, to know whether the commissary ought not to have
accepted a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">recusatio judicis</i>, which I lodged in the court. This, I suppose,
they will determine. I only desire your lordship's explicit opinion,
whether Mr. Garden, (supposing he has power over his own clergy) has
authority to erect such a court to arraign me, belonging to the province of
Georgia. The bearer hereof will give me your lordship's answer; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
favouring me with which, your lordship will oblige your obedient son
and servant,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>It is doubtful whether the words "obedient son and servant"
were quite appropriate. At all events, it is certain,
that, there had been several things in the past career of the
"obedient son and servant," of which his <em>lordship</em> disapproved.
The reply of Bishop Gibson has not been published;
but that the impeachment by Commissary Garden's court
caused Whitefield considerable thought, if not anxiety, is
evident from another letter, which Whitefield sent to a friend
in London, probably by the same messenger as conveyed
the letter addressed to his Diocesan. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The bearer brings the authentic copy of my appeal. I sent you
another copy from Carolina. Be pleased to keep this I have now sent,
till you hear of my coming to England. If I come in the spring, I will
lodge it myself; if not, be pleased to lodge it for me, and I will pay all
expenses."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield landed at Newport, in Rhode Island, on
Sunday evening, September 14, and immediately became
acquainted with the "Rev. Mr. Clap,<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> who had been
the minister of a Dissenting congregation in the island
upwards of forty years. "He was," says Whitefield, "the
most venerable man I ever saw. He looked like a good old
Puritan. His countenance was very heavenly, and I could
not but think, whilst at his table, that I was sitting with
one of the patriarchs. People of all denominations respect
him. He abounds in good works; gives all he has away;
and is wonderfully tender of little children. He rejoiced
much to see me, and prayed most affectionately for a blessing
on my coming." Whitefield and this venerable Dissenting
minister waited on the clergyman of the Church of England,
and desired the use of his pulpit. The request was granted,
and, on the two succeeding days, Whitefield read prayers and
preached in the consecrated edifice, "at ten in the morning
and three in the afternoon." The congregations were very
large; and, at the conclusion of the afternoon service of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
second day, more than a thousand people followed the young
evangelist to the house where he lodged. "I therefore," says
he, "stood upon the threshold, and spake for near an hour
on these words, 'Blessed are they that hunger and thirst
after righteousness: for they shall be filled.' It was a very
solemn meeting. Glory be to God's great name!"</p>

<p>On Wednesday, September 18, Whitefield arrived at
Boston, then the capital of New England.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> This is not the
place to write the remarkable history of this English settlement
It has been estimated that more than twenty-one
thousand emigrants settled in New England prior to the
year 1640. The majority of these were Puritans, or Congregationalists;
and Cotton Mather says four thousand were
Presbyterians. Of the two thousand ministers cast out of the
Church of England by the Act of Uniformity, in 1662, a considerable
number fled for refuge to this distant colony. The
revocation of the Edict of Nantes, in 1685, drove hundreds
of thousands of French Protestants from their native country;
and of these not a few became New Englanders. To a great
extent, the population consisted of godly refugees. A good
general idea concerning the religious denominations of the
settlement as a whole, may be gathered from Oldmixon's
description of Boston in the year 1708. "Boston," says he,
"is the capital of New England, and the biggest city in
America, excepting two or three on the Spanish continent.
There are abundance of fine buildings in it, public and
private: as the court-house, market-place, Sir William Phip's
house, and others. There are several handsome streets. It
contains ten or twelve thousand souls; the militia consisting
of four companies of foot. There are three parish churches,
a French church, and two meeting-houses in the city. The
Old Church, North Church, and South Church belong to the
Presbyterians, who are the <em>Church of England as by law
established</em>; the French church belongs to the French Protestants;
and the meeting-houses, to a congregation of
Church of <em>England</em> men and Anabaptists."</p>

<p>As to the creed of these miscellaneous religionists, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
cannot be a doubt that, speaking generally, it was Calvinistic,
and quite in harmony with those views of election and final
perseverance which Whitefield had embraced. In such a
colony, Wesley would have been branded as a heretic;
whereas Whitefield was warmly welcomed as a friend, whose
faith was gloriously orthodox.</p>

<p>Whitefield was invited to Boston by the Rev. Dr. Colman,
was warmly welcomed by almost all the Bostonians, except a
famous doctor of divinity, who met him in the streets, and
said, "I am sorry to see <em>you</em> here;" and to which Whitefield
quietly remarked, "So is the devil."<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>On September 19, Whitefield commenced his preaching
work in the capital of New England. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Friday, September 19. I was visited by several gentlemen and
ministers, and went to the governor's with Mr. Willard,<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> the secretary
of the province, a man fearing God, and with whom I have corresponded,
though before unknown in person. The governor received me with the
utmost respect, and desired to see me as often as I could. At eleven, I
went to public worship at the Church of England, and afterwards went
home with the commissary. He treated me very courteously; and, it
being the day whereon the clergy of the Established Church met, I had
an opportunity of conversing with five of them. In the afternoon I
preached to about four thousand in Dr. Colman's meeting-house; and
afterwards exhorted and prayed with many who came to my lodgings.</p>

<p>"Saturday, September 20. Preached in the morning, to about six
thousand hearers, in the Rev. Dr. Sewall's<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> meeting-house; and afterwards,
on the common, to about eight thousand; and again, at night, to
a thronged company at my lodgings.</p>

<p>"Sunday, September 21. Went in the morning, and heard Dr. Colman
preach. Dined with his colleague, the Rev. Mr. Cooper.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Preached in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
the afternoon at Mr. Foxcroft's<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> meeting. Immediately after, on the
common, to about fifteen thousand; and again, at my lodgings, to a
greater company than before.</p>

<p>"Monday, September 22. Preached this morning, at the Rev. Mr.
Webb's<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> meeting-house, to six thousand hearers in the house, besides
great numbers standing about the doors. In the afternoon I went to
preach at the Rev. Mr. Checkley's<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> meeting-house; but God was pleased
to humble us by a very awful providence. The meeting-house being filled,
on a sudden all the people were in an uproar, and so unaccountably surprised,
that some threw themselves out of the windows, others threw
themselves out of the gallery, and others trampled upon one another; so
that five were actually killed, and others dangerously wounded. I happened
to come in the midst of the uproar, and saw two or three lying on
the ground in a pitiable condition. I gave notice I would immediately
preach upon the common. The weather was wet, but many thousands followed
in the field.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, September 23. Went this morning, with Dr. Colman and
the Secretary, to Roxbury, to see the Rev. Mr. Walter,<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> a good old
Puritan. He and his predecessor, the Rev. Mr. Eliot, commonly called
the 'Apostle of the Indians,' have been pastors of that congregation a
hundred and six years. About eleven, I preached in the Rev. Mr. Gee's<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
meeting-house, and also in the afternoon, to thronged congregations.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, September 24. Preached at Cambridge, the chief college<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
in New England for training the sons of the prophets. It has one president,
four tutors, and about a hundred students. The college is scarce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
as big as one of our least colleges at Oxford; and, as far as I could gather
from some who knew the state of it, not far superior to our universities in
piety. Discipline is at a low ebb. Bad books are become fashionable
among the tutors and students. Tillotson and Clark are read, instead of
Sheppard, Stoddard, and such-like evangelical writers; and, therefore, I
chose to preach from these words,&mdash;'We are not as many, who corrupt the
word of God;' and God gave me great freedom and boldness of speech. A
great number of neighbouring ministers attended, as indeed they do at all
other times. The president of the college and minister of the parish treated
me very civilly. In the afternoon, I preached again, in the court. I believe
there were about seven thousand hearers. The Holy Spirit melted many
hearts.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>"Thursday, September 25. Preached the weekly lecture at Mr. Foxcroft's
meeting-house. After public worship, I went, at his Excellency's
invitation, and dined with him. Most of the ministers of the town were
invited with me. Before dinner, the governor sent for me into his
chamber. He wept, wished me good luck in the name of the Lord, and
recommended himself, ministers, and people to my prayers.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Immediately
after dinner, I prayed for them all; and then crossed the ferry, and
preached at Charlestown, lying on the north side of Boston. The
meeting-house was very capacious, and quite filled.</p>

<p>"Friday, September 26. Preached in the morning at Roxbury to many
thousands of people. Dined at Judge Dudley's. In the afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
preached from a scaffold erected without the Rev. Mr. Byles's<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> meeting-house,
to a congregation nearly double of that in the morning.</p>

<p>"Saturday, September 27. In the morning, preached at the Rev. Mr.
Welstead's meeting-house; in the afternoon, on the common, to about
15,000 people. Oh, how did the word run! I could scarce abstain from
crying out, 'This is no other than the house of God and the gate of
heaven.'</p>

<p>"Sunday, September 28. Preached, in the morning, at good Dr.
Sewall's meeting-house, to a very crowded auditory, and, £555 currency
were collected for the Orphan House. In the afternoon, I preached at Dr.
Colman's; and here £470 were collected. In both places, all things were
carried on with great decency and order. After sermon, I had the honour
of a private visit from the governor. I then went and preached to a
great number of negroes, on the conversion of the Ethiopian; and, at my
return, gave a word of exhortation to a crowd of people, who were waiting
at my lodgings. I went to bed greatly refreshed with divine consolations."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield had now spent ten days in Boston and its
immediate neighbourhood. The next seven days were
employed in visiting several important towns at a greater
distance; after which, the popular evangelist returned to the
capital of the province. Before following him in his
itinerancy, selections from letters, written at this period,
will be useful. The following was addressed to him by
Charles Wesley:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Bristol</span>, <em>September 1, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dearest Brother and Fellow-labourer in the Gospel</span>,&mdash;You
will sing, rejoice, and give thanks for the Divine goodness toward me.
God has lifted me up from the gates of death.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> For this month past, He
has visited me with a violent fever. There was no human probability of
my surviving it; but I knew in myself that I should not die. I have not
finished my course, and scarce begun it. The prayer of faith prevailed.
Jesus touched my hand, and immediately the fever departed from me. I
am now slowly recovering my strength, and can walk across my room;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
but I have no use of my hand or head yet. I wait on the Lord, and shall
renew my strength.</p>

<p>"The great work goes forward, maugre all the opposition of earth and
hell. The most violent opposers of all are our own brethren of Fetter
Lane that were. We have gathered up between twenty and thirty from
the wreck, and transplanted them to the Foundery. Innumerable have
been the devices to scatter this little flock. They are indefatigable in
bringing us off from our 'carnal ordinances,' and speak with such wisdom
from beneath, that, if it were possible, they would deceive the very elect.</p>

<p>"You will expect some account of your own household. But what
shall I say concerning them? I must either deceive or grieve you; but
you have a right to the simple truth. Your mother continues dead in sin,
yet well affected toward us. Your sister (God help her! God convert
her!) is far, very far, from the kingdom of heaven. She has forsaken the
word, and servants, and ministers of Christ, put herself out of the bands,
and is the worst enemy they have. Her complaints, that the Methodists
were burdensome to her, forced me, after paying for my board, to hasten
to my lodging at the New Room. But this is a trifle; it is her own
private behaviour and her carriage towards the Church of God, I totally
condemn. Infinite pains have been taken with her to set her against my
brother and me. I know not what to do with her or for her, and had
long since given her up had she not been the sister of my friend.</p>

<p>"My brother has been most grossly abused; his behaviour (if I may
be a witness) has been truly Christian. All the bitterness his opposers
have shewn, and the woes and curses they have denounced against him,
have never provoked him to a like return, or stirred his temper, or
impaired his charity; much less are we cooled in our affection towards
you, by all the idle stories we hear of your opposition to us. Well-meaning
Mr. Seward has caused the world to triumph in our supposed dissensions,
by his unseasonable journal. Your zealous, indiscreet friends, instead of
concealing any little difference between us, have told it in Gath, and published
it in Askelon; but I trust, by our first meeting, all will know that
those things whereof they were informed concerning us are nothing, while
we stand fast in one mind and in one spirit, striving together for the faith
of the gospel. This is of the last importance to the cause we maintain,
which suffered so much, as you well observe, by the dissensions of the
first Reformers. Their divisions stopped the work of God then, and in
the next age destroyed it. Oh, my friend, if you have the glory of God
and the salvation of souls at heart, resolve, by the Divine grace, that
nothing upon earth, nor under the earth, shall part us. God increase the
horror He has given me of a separation! I had rather you saw me dead
at your feet than openly opposing you. All the lovers of discord, I trust,
shall be confounded; even those, of whatever denomination, who, through
fondness for their own opinion, would destroy the work of God. Many,
I know, desire nothing so much as to see George Whitefield and John
Wesley at the head of different parties, as is plain from their truly devilish
pains to effect it; but be assured, my dearest brother, our heart is as your
heart. Oh, may we always thus continue to think and speak the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
things! When God has taught us mutual forbearance, long-suffering,
and love, who knows but He may bring us into an exact agreement in all
things? In the meantime, I do not think the difference considerable. I
shall never dispute with you touching election; and, if you know not yet
to reconcile that doctrine with God's universal love, I will cry unto Him,
'Lord, what we know not, shew Thou us!' but never offend you by my
different sentiment. My soul is set upon peace, and drawn after you by
love stronger than death. You know not how dear you are to me; not
dearer, I will be bold to say, to any of your natural or spiritual relations.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>The doctrinal differences between Whitefield and the
Wesley brothers, and the possibility of their being separated,
evidently caused the whole three to feel great anxiety. The
following extracts from Whitefield's letters, coupled with
Charles Wesley's letter, will sufficiently prove this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, <em>September 23, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<i>Sinless perfection</i>, I think, is unattainable in this life. Shew me a
man that could ever justly say, 'I am perfect.' It is enough if we can say
so when we bow down our heads and give up the ghost. <em>Indwelling sin</em>
remains till death, even in the regenerate, as the article of the Church
expresses it. There is no man that liveth and sinneth not in thought,
word, and deed. However, to affirm such a thing as <em>perfection</em>, and to
deny <em>final perseverance</em>, what an absurdity is this!<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> To be incapable of
sinning,<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> and capable of being finally damned, is a contradiction in terms.
From such doctrine may I ever turn away! I hear many amongst you,
who begun in the spirit, are now ending in the flesh. Christ hath freely
justified them; that is, entitled them to all His merits; and yet they must
do so-and-so to keep themselves in a justified state. Alas! this is sorry
divinity! I have not so learned Christ&mdash;no; His gifts and callings are
without repentance. Whom He loves, He loves to the end. Work I
will, but not to keep myself in a justified state. My Lord hath secured
that; but I will work to shew my gratitude for His putting me into a
justified state."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following was addressed to Howell Harris:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, <em>September 24, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"And is dear brother Howell Harris yet alive in body and soul? I
rejoice in your success. I hope your conversation was blessed to dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
Mr. Wesley. O that the Lord may batter down his free-will, and compel
him to own His sovereignty and everlasting love! Some of Fetter Lane
Society, I fear, are running into sad errors. My coming to England will
try my fidelity to my Master. Nothing but His strength can enable me
to bear all contradictions with meekness."</p></blockquote>

<p>On September 25, Whitefield wrote a long letter to
Wesley, in which he tried to shew that, what he calls the
doctrine of <em>sinless perfection</em> is unscriptural; and concludes
with a reference to the recent publication of Wesley's
celebrated sermon, entitled "Free Grace," in which he
exhibited and refuted the doctrine of predestination.
Whitefield writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I find your sermon has had its expected success; it has set the nation
a disputing. You will have enough to do now to answer pamphlets.
Two I have already seen. O that you would be more cautious in casting
lots!<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> O that you would not be rash and precipitate! If you go on
thus, honoured sir, how can I concur with you? It is impossible. I
must speak what I know. Thus I write out of the fulness of my heart.
About spring, you may expect to see, ever, ever yours in Christ,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Things were approaching a crisis. Three days afterwards,
Whitefield wrote to Wesley another letter,&mdash;the least loving
he had ever sent to his "honoured friend."</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, <em>September 28, 1740</em>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Brother Wesley</span>,&mdash;What mean you by disputing in all your
letters?<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> May God give you to know yourself; and then you will not
plead for <em>absolute perfection</em>, or call the doctrine of <em>election</em> a 'doctrine of
devils.' My dear brother, take heed. See you are in Christ a new
creature. Beware of a false peace. Strive to enter in at the strait
gate; and give all diligence to make your calling and election sure.
Remember you are but a babe in Christ, if so much. Be humble; talk
little; think and pray much. Let God teach you; and He will lead you
into all truth. I love you heartily. I pray you may be kept from error,
both in principle and practice. Salute all the brethren. If you must
dispute, stay till you are master of the subject; otherwise you will hurt
the cause you would defend. Study to adorn the gospel of our Lord in
all things; and forget not to pray for your affectionate friend and servant,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>
<p>This hortatory letter was very different in tone from the
letter which Whitefield had previously addressed to Wesley;
and, considering Wesley's seniority and other circumstances,
it was scarcely modest. Whitefield was growing angry,
though, perhaps, he hardly knew it. To another friend he
wrote, on September 26:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I hope nothing will cause a division between me and Messrs. Wesley.
But I must speak what I know, and confute error wheresoever I find it."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the same day he wrote to the Rev. Benjamin Ingham,
the Moravian evangelist in Yorkshire:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I find our friends are got into disputing one with another. O that the
God of peace may put a stop to it! If we are divided among ourselves,
what an advantage will Satan gain over us! Let us love one another,
excite all to come to Christ without exception, and our Lord will shew us
who are His."</p></blockquote>

<p>Before proceeding with Whitefield's Journal, another letter
must be introduced. William Delamotte was acting as
Ingham's coadjutor in Yorkshire. He had left the Church
of England, and become a Moravian. About this period,
he began to preach, but his career was soon ended. He
died February 22, 1743, and was buried at St. Dunstan's in
the East, London.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> To this brother of the young lady,
whom Whitefield, in so strange a manner, had asked to
become his wife, the following was addressed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, <em>September 28, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Brother William</span>,&mdash;I thank you for your kind letter from
Osset. I wish it was written with more life. I fear you are turning almost
to a spirit of bondage; but it is good for you to be sifted, to make an
experienced minister of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"I could not but smile, to find you wink at the <em>decency of my dress</em>.
Alas! my brother, I have long since known what it is to be in that state,
into which I fear you are about to enter. I once thought that Christianity
required me to go nasty. I neglected myself as much as you would have
me, for about a twelvemonth; but, when God gave me the spirit of adoption,
I then dressed <em>decently</em>, as you call it, out of principle; and I am
more and more convinced, that the Lord would have, me act, in that
respect, as I do.</p>

<p>"God only knows whether you have done right in leaving the University,
or in declining to exhort. If you do not preach till you are perfectly free
from all sin, I believe you will never preach again. I could never hear of
such a minister or Christian yet. Jesus Christ sent His disciples to preach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
before they were perfect; nay, when they were weak in grace. Exercise
the talents you have; that is the way to get more. Thus God has dealt
with me for these seven years.</p>

<p>"Many of our friends talk against election. A good reason may be
given. I believe they have never taken pains to search into the true state
of the case. But I will say no more. Our dear Master is doing wonders
amongst us. Praise Him lustily, and with a good courage, Adieu!</p></blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield.</span>"
</p>

<p>We must now return to Whitefield's itinerary. Leaving
Boston on Monday morning, September 29, he rode forty
miles to Ipswich; and, during the day, preached twice, at
Marble Head and Salem, to assembled thousands. Next
day, he had two immense congregations at Ipswich and
Newbury. On Wednesday, October 1, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Preached in the morning, though not with so much freedom as usual,
at Hampton, to some thousands in the open air. Some, though not many,
were affected. After dinner, rode to Portsmouth, fourteen miles from
Hampton, and preached to a polite auditory, and so very unconcerned,
that I began to question whether I had been preaching to rational or
brute creatures. Immediately after sermon, I went over a very stony way
to York, thirteen miles from Portsmouth, to see one Mr. Moody, a worthy,
plain, and powerful minister of Jesus Christ, though now much impaired by
old age. He has lived by faith for many years, has been much despised by
bad men, and as much respected by the true lovers of the blessed Jesus.</p>

<p>"Thursday, October 3. Was comforted to hear good Mr. Moody tell
me, that he believed I should preach to a hundred new creatures in his
congregation this morning. And, indeed, I believe I did. I preached
both morning and evening. The hearers looked plain and simple; and
tears trickled apace down their cheeks.</p>

<p>"Friday, October 3. Preached this morning, at Portsmouth, to a far
greater congregation than before; but, instead of preaching to dead stocks,
I had now reason to believe I was preaching to living men. People began
to melt soon after I began to pray, and the influence increased more and
more during the whole sermon. Good Mr. Shutlif, the minister, when he
afterwards sent me £97, collected at this time for the orphans, wrote
thus: 'You have left great numbers under deep impressions, and I trust
in God they will not wear off.' After dinner, I hastened to Hampstead,
and preached to several thousands of people with a great deal of life and
power. Collected £41 for the orphan children, and set out directly for
Newbury, which we reached about eight at night.</p>

<p>"Saturday, October 4. Preached in the morning to a very thronged
congregation. Collected £80. Hasted to Ipswich. Preached to a larger
congregation than when there last. Collected £79 for the orphans. Got
to Salem at night.</p>

<p>"Sunday, October 5. Preached, at eight in the morning, in the meeting-house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
at the minister's request. Read prayers, and assisted at the
sacrament, in the Church of England. Preached again, in the afternoon,
in the meeting-house; and collected £72 for the orphans.</p>

<p>"Monday, October 6. Preached at Marble Head about eleven. The
two ministers presented me with £70 for the Orphan House, which they
had collected yesterday in their own private meetings. Went to Maulden,
fourteen miles from Marble Head, and preached, but not with so much
enlargement as in the morning. Got privately into Boston about seven
at night; and, though I had ridden a hundred and seventy-eight miles,
and preached sixteen times, yet I was not in the least wearied."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield might have added to this account of his week's
work in the country, that, he had collected £359 for his
orphans in Georgia. Further extracts from his Journal,
which now will soon be ended, cannot fail to interest the
thoughtful reader:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Tuesday, October 7. Preached, both morning and evening, in Dr.
Colman's meeting-house, with much power. I now, almost hourly,
receive letters from persons under convictions.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, October 8. Went with the governor, in his coach, to
Mr. Webb's meeting-house, where I preached, morning and evening, to
very great auditories. Both times, many hearts were melted down. I
think I never was so drawn out to pray for little children, and invite them
to Jesus Christ. I had just heard of a child, who, after hearing me preach,
was immediately taken sick, and said, 'I will go to Mr. Whitefield's God.'
In a short time he died. This encouraged me to speak to little ones;
but, oh, how were the old people affected, when I said, 'Little children,
if your parents will not come to Christ, do you come, and go to heaven
without them.' There seemed to be but few dry eyes. I have not seen
a greater commotion during my preaching at Boston.</p>

<p>"Thursday, October 9. Every morning, since my return, I have been
applied to by many souls under deep distress. Expounded at Dr. Sewall's
meeting-house, which was very much crowded. The Lord enabled me
to open my mouth boldly against unconverted ministers; for, I am persuaded,
the generality of preachers talk of an unknown and unfelt Christ.
The reason why congregations have been so dead is, because they have
had dead men preaching to them. O that the Lord may quicken and
revive them! How can dead men beget living children? It is true,
indeed, that God may convert men by the devil, if He chooses; and
so He may by unconverted ministers; but, I believe; He seldom
makes use of either of them for this purpose. No: He chooses vessels
made meet by the operations of His blessed Spirit. For my own part,
I would not lay hands on an unconverted man for ten thousand
worlds. Unspeakable freedom God gave me while treating on this head:
and many ministers were present. In the afternoon, I preached, on the
common, to about fifteen thousand people, and collected upwards of £200
of New England currency for the orphans. In the evening, I went to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
almshouse, and preached for near half an hour; then I went to the workhouse,
where I exhorted a great number of people for near an hour more;
and then, hearing there was a considerable number waiting for a word of
exhortation at my lodgings, God strengthened me to give them a spiritual
morsel. Soon after I retired to rest.</p>

<p>"Friday, October 10. Was still busied, from the very moment I arose
until I went out, in answering those that came to me under great distress.
Went over Charlestown ferry, where I preached with much freedom of
spirit. Hastened to Redding, twelve miles from Charlestown, where I
preached to many thousands. A considerable moving was discernible in
the congregation.</p>

<p>"Saturday, October 11. Went again to Cambridge, and preached, at
the meeting-house door, to a great body of people, who stood very attentively
(though it rained), and were much affected. It being the town of the
University, I discoursed on these words, 'Noah, a preacher of righteousness'
and endeavoured to shew the qualifications for a true evangelical
preacher of Christ's righteousness. After sermon, the president kindly
entertained me and my friends.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> About four, we reached Boston, where I
preached, immediately, in Ur. Sewall's meeting-house. I exhorted a
great number afterwards at my lodgings; and then was employed, till
near midnight, in settling my private affairs, answering letters, and speaking
to those under conviction.</p>

<p>"Sunday, October 12. Spoke to as many as I could, who came for
spiritual advice. Preached, with great power, at Dr. Sewall's meeting-house,
which was so exceedingly thronged, that I was obliged to get in at
one of the windows. Went with the governor, in his coach, to the
common, where I preached my farewell sermon to near twenty thousand
people,&mdash;a sight I have not seen since I left Blackheath. Numbers, great
numbers, melted into tears. After sermon, the governor went with me to
my lodgings. I stood in the passage, and spoke to a great company, both
within and without doors. The remainder of the evening was almost
entirely spent in speaking to persons under great distress of soul.</p>

<p>"Monday, October 13. Took an affectionate leave of many dear
friends. Went with the governor, in his coach, to Charlestown ferry,
where he handed me into the boat, kissed me, and with tears bid me farewell.
Blessed be God! for what He has done at Boston. I hope a
glorious work is begun, and that the Lord will stir up faithful labourers
to carry it on. Boston is a large populous place, and very wealthy. It
has the form kept up very well, but has lost much of the power of religion.
I have not heard of any remarkable stir in it for many years.
Ministers and people are obliged to confess that the love of many is
waxed cold. Both seem too much conformed to the world. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
much of the pride of life to be seen in their assemblies. Jewels, patches,
and gay apparel are commonly worn by the female sex. I observed little
boys and girls commonly dressed up in the pride of life; and the infants,
that were brought to baptism, were wrapped in such finery, that one
would think they were brought thither, to be initiated into, rather than to
renounce, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world. Boston, however,
is remarkable for the external observance of the Sabbath. Men in civil
offices have a regard for religion. The governor encourages them; and
the ministers and magistrates seem to be more united, than those in any
other place where I have been. I never saw so little scoffing; never had
so little opposition. Still, I fear, many rest in a head-knowledge, are
close Pharisees, and have only a name to live. Boston people are dear
to my soul, and were very liberal to my dear orphans. I promised to
visit them again. There are nine meeting-houses of the Congregational
persuasion; one Baptist; one French; and one belonging to the Scotch-Irish."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus ended Whitefield's first visit to the capital of New
England. "God works by me," he wrote, "more than ever.
I am quite well in bodily health. Ministers, as well as people,
are stirred up, and the Government is exceeding civil. I
have already collected upwards of £400 sterling for the
Orphan House. God shews me that America must be my
place for action."<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> The following description of Whitefield's
preaching is extracted, from a work published in Boston,
entitled "The Rebels":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is nothing in the appearance of this remarkable man which
would lead you to suppose that a Felix would tremble before him. To
have seen him when he first commenced, one would have thought him
anything but enthusiastic and glowing; but, as he proceeded, his heart
warmed with his subject, and his manner became impetuous, till, forgetful
of everything around him, he seemed to kneel at the throne of Jehovah,
and to beseech in agony for his fellow-beings.</p>

<p>"After he had finished his prayer, he knelt a long time in profound
silence; and so powerfully had it affected the most heartless of his
audience, that a stillness like that of the tomb pervaded the whole
house.</p>

<p>"Before he commenced his sermon, long, darkening columns crowded
the bright sunny sky of the morning, and swept their dull shadows over,
the building, in fearful augury of the storm that was approaching.</p>

<p>"'See that emblem of human life,' said he, as he pointed to a flitting,
shadow. 'It passed for a moment, and concealed the brightness of heaven
from our view; but it is gone. And where will you be, my hearers, when
your lives have passed away like that dark cloud? Oh, my dear friends, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
see thousands sitting attentive, with their eyes fixed on the poor unworthy
preacher. In a few days, we shall all meet at the judgment-seat of Christ.
We shall form a part of that vast assembly which will gather before His
throne. Every eye will behold the Judge. With a voice whose call you
must abide and answer, He will enquire, whether on earth you strove to
enter in at the strait gate; whether you were supremely devoted to God;
whether your hearts were absorbed in Him. My blood runs cold when I
think how many of you will then seek to enter in, and shall not be able.
O what plea can you make before the Judge of the whole earth? Can you
say it has been your whole endeavour to mortify the flesh, with its affections
and lusts? No! you must answer, I made myself easy in the world, by
flattering myself that all would end well; but I have deceived my own
soul, and am lost.</p>

<p>"'O false and hollow Christians, of what avail will it be that you have
done many things? that you have read much in the sacred Word? that
you have made long prayers? that you have attended religious duties, and
appeared holy in the eyes of men? What will all this be, if, instead of
loving God supremely, you have been supposing you should exalt yourselves
in heaven by acts really polluted and unholy?</p>

<p>"'And you, rich men, wherefore do you hoard your silver? Wherefore
count the price you have received for Him whom you every day crucify in
your love of gain? Why, that, when you are too poor to buy a drop of cold
water, your beloved son may be rolled into hell in his chariot, pillowed and
cushioned.</p>

<p>"'O sinner! by all your hopes of happiness, I beseech you to repent.
Let not the wrath of God be awakened! Let not the fires of eternity be
kindled against you! See there!' said the impassioned preacher, pointing
to a flash of lightning, 'It is a glance from the angry eye of Jehovah!
Hark!' continued he, raising his finger in a listening attitude, as the
thunder broke in a tremendous crash, 'it was the voice of the Almighty
as He passed by in His anger!'</p>

<p>"As the sound died away, Whitefield covered his face with his hands,
and fell on his knees, apparently lost in prayer. The storm passed rapidly
by, and the sun, bursting forth, threw across the heavens the magnificent
arch of peace. Rising and pointing to it, the young preacher cried, 'Look
upon the rainbow, and praise Him who made it. Very beautiful it is in
the brightness thereof. It compasseth the heavens about with glory, and
the hands of the Most High have bended it.'"<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This may be taken as a fair specimen of Whitefield's
impromptu eloquence. It is said, Whitefield was requested,
by his hearers, to furnish a copy of his sermon for publication.
"I have no objection," said he, "if you will print the
lightning, thunder, and rainbow with it."</p>

<p>What were the results of Whitefield's preaching in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
capital of New England, and in its immediate vicinity?
This question is answered, in part, by the following extracts
from letters, published at the time in a folio newspaper,
entitled, "Postscript to the <cite>South Carolina Gazette</cite>, No.
361. Charleston: printed by Peter Timothy, in King
Street." The letters seem to have been addressed to the
Rev. Josiah Smith,<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> of Charleston, and were sent by him
to Mr. Timothy for publication.</p>

"<em>October 1, 1740.</em>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Rev. and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You raised our expectations of Mr. Whitefield
very much; but, now we have seen and heard him, we all own that our
expectations are answered and exceeded, not only in his zealous and
abounding labours, but in his command of the hearts and affections of his
hearers. He has been received here" (Boston) "as an angel of God and
servant of Jesus Christ."</p>

<p class="sig">
"<em>October 22, 1740.</em>
</p>

<p>"I perceive you are impatient to know what manner of entering in Mr.
Whitefield had among us. <em>His own received him not</em>; <a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>but <em>we</em> (ministers,
rulers, and people,) generally received him as an angel of God, or as Elias,
or John the Baptist risen from the dead. When he preached his farewell
sermon, on our common, there were, at a moderate computation, twenty-three
thousand present. Such a power and presence of God with a
preacher, and in religious assemblies, I never saw before, and am ready
to fear I shall never see again. The prejudices of many are quite conquered,
and the expectations of others vastly outdone, as they freely own.
A considerable number are <em>awakened</em>, and many Christians seem to be
greatly quickened. In this town" (Boston) "whoever goes to lessen Mr.
Whitefield's reputation, is in danger of losing his own. He has preached
twice at Cambridge. He has there one warm friend, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, the tutor,
who has followed him to Northampton, and will, for aught I know, follow
him to Georgia. But Mr. Whitefield has not a warmer friend anywhere
than in the first man among us. Our governor can call him nothing less
than the Apostle Paul. He has shewn him the highest respect; carried
him in his coach from place to place; and could not help following him
fifty miles out of town."</p>

<p class="sig">
"<em>November 1, 1740.</em>
</p>

<p>"I received yours by the Rev. Mr. Whitefield, with whom I coveted a
great deal more private conversation than I had opportunity for, by reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
of the throngs of people, that were almost perpetually with him; but he
appears to me to be full of the love of God, and to be fired with an extraordinary
zeal for the cause of Christ. He applies himself, with the most
indefatigable diligence, to promoting the good of souls. His head, his
heart, and his hands seem to be full of his Master's business. His discourses
(especially when he goes into an expository way) are very entertaining.
Every eye is fixed upon him, and every ear chained to his lips. Most are
very much affected; many awakened and convinced; and a general seriousness
is excited. His address to the passions is wonderful, and beyond
what I have ever seen. Although I can by no means go his length in
censuring, yet I can make allowance for such things, when I see the
fervour of his soul, and how the zeal of God's house hath eaten him up.
I can truly say that his preaching has quickened <em>me</em>, and I believe it has
many ministers besides, as well as the people.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Several of my flock,
especially of the younger sort, have been with me, manifesting the great
convictions that were stirred up in them by Mr. Whitefield's preaching;
and there is this also among other good effects of his preaching, that the
word preached now by <em>us</em> seems more precious to them, and comes with
more power upon them."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Rev. William Cooper wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Ministers and people received Mr. Whitefield with raised expectations,
and found them all answered. We lead our people to the crowded assemblies,
but the Church ministers warn their people against hearing him.
The day he arrived, he preached in our meeting-house to 5,000 hearers.
He is a holy, fervent youth, but I think has too much action with his
fervour. He strikes pleasing light in opening the Scripture, and has the
greatest command Over the affections of the audience, in the application,
I ever knew. We are, at times, all in tears. Young and old have been
greatly affected, and we have great reason to bless God for his visit."<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>
<p>These extracts are useful in shewing the impressions left
on the minds of Christian ministers and persons of education,
who had been among Whitefield's hearers. From Prince's
"Christian History," published soon afterwards, we learn
other facts. The Rev. Mr. Prince, father of the publisher
just mentioned, writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Though Mr. Whitefield, now and then, dropped expressions that were
not so accurate and guarded as we should expect from aged and long-studied
ministers, yet I had the satisfaction to observe his readiness to receive
correction as soon as offered. He was a most importunate wooer of souls
to come to Christ. He applied his exhortations to the elderly people, the
middle-aged, the young, the Indians, and the negroes; and had a most
winning way of addressing them. He affectionately prayed for our magistrates,
ministers, colleges, candidates for the ministry, and churches, as
well as people in general. Multitudes were greatly affected, and many
awakened by his lively ministry. Though he preached every day, the
houses were exceedingly crowded; and almost every evening the house
where he lodged was thronged to hear his prayers and counsels. He also
preached in several neighbouring towns; travelled and preached as far
as York, above seventy miles north-east of Boston; returned hither, and
gave us his farewell sermon on October 12. Upon his leaving us, great
numbers were concerned about their souls; so that our assemblies were
surprisingly increased, and the people wanted to hear us oftener than
ever."<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thus was Whitefield employed, by God, in reviving
religion in American churches, as Wesley was in England.
The two men had two separate missions, and well they
fulfilled them. Two months after Whitefield's departure, he
was succeeded in Boston, by Gilbert Tennent, "a man," says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
the Rev. Mr. Prince,<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> "of considerable parts and learning;
free, gentle, condescending. Many had been awakened by
his ministry in New Jersey, where he lived; and he had as
deep an acquaintance with the experimental part of religion
as any I have conversed with. He seemed to have no
regard to please the eyes of his hearers with agreeable
gesture, nor their ears with delivery, nor their fancy with
language; but to aim directly at their hearts and consciences,
to lay open their ruinous delusions, to shew them
their numerous secret, hypocritical shifts in religion, and
to drive them out of their deceitful refuge, wherein they made
themselves easy with the form of godliness without the
power. From the terrible and deep convictions he had
passed through in his own soul, he seemed to have such a
lively view of the Divine Majesty,&mdash;the spirituality, purity,
extensiveness, and strictness of His law, with His glorious
holiness and displeasure at sin, His justice, truth, and power
in punishing the damned,&mdash;that the very terrors of God
seemed to rise in his mind afresh, when he displayed and
brandished them in the eyes of unreconciled sinners."</p>

<p>Gilbert Tennent remained nearly four months in Boston,
and was marvellously instrumental in carrying on the work
which had been begun by Whitefield. His preaching was
searching, and often terrible. Many hundreds were convinced
of sin by his powerful ministry. The ministers of
Boston were inspired with new faith, and life, and power.
"And now," says Mr. Prince, "was such a time as we never
knew. The Rev. Mr. Cooper was wont to say, that more
came to him, in one week, in deep concern about their souls,
than had come in the whole twenty-four years of his preceding
ministry. I can also say the same as to the numbers who
repaired to me. Mr. Cooper had about six hundred persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
in three months; and Mr. Webb had, in the same space,
above a thousand. There repaired to us boys and girls,
young men and women, Indians and negroes, heads of
families and aged persons; some in great distress for fear
of being unconverted; others lest they had all along been
building on a righteousness of their own, and were still in the
gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity; some fearing lest
the Holy Spirit should withdraw Himself; others in great
anxiety lest He should leave them for ever. Nor were the
same persons satisfied with coming once or twice, as formerly;
but they came again and again, I know not how often, complaining
of their evil and accursed hearts; of their past and
present unbelief; of their pride, hypocrisy, and perfidiousness;
of their love and captivity to sin; and of their utter
impotence to help themselves, or even to believe on Christ."</p>

<p>This wondrous movement continued for a year and a half
after Whitefield's departure from Boston. Thirty religious
Societies were instituted in the city. Ministers, besides
attending to their usual work, preached in private houses
almost every night. Chapels were always crowded. "The
very face of the town seemed to be strangely altered. Even
the negroes and boys in the streets left their usual rudeness,
and taverns were found empty of all but lodgers." "Our
lectures," wrote Dr. Colman, in a letter to Dr. Isaac Watts,
dated September 15, 1741, "our lectures nourish, our
Sabbaths are joyous, our churches increase, our ministers
have new life and spirit in their work."<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>But it is time to follow Whitefield in his glorious wanderings.
Leaving Boston, on Monday, October 13, he
proceeded to Concord, "preached to some thousands in the
open air, and collected about £45 for the orphans." Next
day, he preached at Sudbury and at Marlborough. He
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When I came into the meeting-house at Marlborough, to my surprise,
I saw Governor Belcher there; and, though it rained, and he was much
advanced in years, he went with us as far as Worcester.</p>

<p>"Wednesday, October 15. Perceived Governor Belcher to be more
affectionate than ever. After morning prayer, he took me by myself, and
exhorted me to go on in stirring up the ministers; for, said he, 'reformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
must begin at the house of God.' As we were going to meeting, he
said, 'Mr. Whitefield, do not spare rulers any more than ministers, no, not
the chief of them.' I preached in the open air to some thousands. The
word fell with weight. After sermon, the governor remarked, 'I pray
God, I may apply what has been said to my own heart. Pray, Mr.
Whitefield, that I may hunger and thirst after righteousness.' Dinner
being ended, with tears in his eyes, he kissed me, and took leave of me."</p></blockquote>

<p>Two days afterwards, Whitefield arrived at Northampton,
where, a few years before, there had been a remarkable work
of God. Northampton was founded about the year 1655,
and its population now consisted of two hundred families.
Its first minister was the Rev. Eleazar Mather, who was
ordained in 1669. He was succeeded, in 1672, by the
Rev. Mr. Stoddard, whose ministry was exercised at Northampton
for the long period of fifty-seven years, during which
he had what he called "five harvests," or revivals of religion.
In 1729, Mr. Stoddard died, and his grandson, Jonathan
Edwards, took his place. Mr. Edwards was not an orator,
like Whitefield. He had no Boanergean voice to thunder
in the ear, nor had he physical power to "dang to pieces"
pulpits and Bibles. He was, says one who knew him, "a
preacher of a low and moderate voice, a natural way of delivery,
and without any agitation of body, or anything else in
the manner, to excite attention, except his habitual and great
solemnity, looking and speaking as in the presence of God,
and with a weighty sense of the matter delivered."<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>At the time when Mr. Edwards commenced his ministry,
the Northampton Church was in a Laodicean state, and the
town generally too much resembled Sodom and Gomorrah.
"Licentiousness," writes Mr. Edwards, "prevailed among the
youth of the town. Many of them were very much addicted
to night-walking, and frequenting the taverns. Very often
they got together, in conventions of both sexes, for mirth and
jollity, which they called frolics; and they would often spend
the greater part of the night in them." In 1735, a change
took place. Mr. Edwards, in his "Narrative of late Surprising
Conversions in New England," published in 1737,
observes:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"There was scarcely a single person in the town of Northampton,
either old or young, that was left unconcerned about the things of the
eternal world. Those, who were wont to be the vainest and loosest, were
now generally subject to great awakenings. The town seemed to be full
of the presence of God. It never was so full of love, nor so full of joy;
and, yet, so full of distress, as it was then. There were remarkable tokens
of God's presence in almost every house. Our public services were
beautiful."</p></blockquote>

<p>This remarkable movement spread to South Hadley, Suffield,
Sunderland, Green River, Hatfied, West Springfield,
Long Meadow, Enfield, Westfield, Northfield, Windsor,
Coventry, Durham, Stratford, New Haven, Guildford, Mansfield,
Preston, and other places. Edwards calculated that
three hundred were converted in Northampton only; and the
conversions in other towns were proportionately numerous.
The whole region, now visited by Whitefield, had, five years
before, been blessed with "showers of blessing." How was
Whitefield welcomed? The following are extracts from his
Journal:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Friday, October 17. We crossed the ferry to Northampton, where
no less than three hundred souls were saved about five years ago. Their
pastor's name is Edwards, successor and grandson to the great Stoddard,
whose memory will be always precious in New England. Mr. Edwards
is a solid, excellent Christian, but, at present, weak in body. When I
came into his pulpit, I found my heart drawn out to talk of scarce anything
besides the consolations and privileges of saints, and the plentiful
effusion of the Spirit upon believers. When I came to remind them of
their former experiences, and how zealous and lively they were at that
time, both minister and people wept much.</p>

<p>"Saturday, October 18. At Mr. Edwards's request, I spoke to his little
children, who were much affected. Preached at Hadfield, five miles from
Northampton, but found myself not much strengthened. Preached in the
afternoon to Mr. Edwards's congregation. God vouchsafed to give me an
affecting prospect of the upper world, and, therefore, I was enabled to
speak with some degree of pathos. Few eyes were dry, and it seemed as
if a time of refreshing was come from the presence of the Lord.</p>

<p>"Sunday, October 19. Preached this morning, and good Mr. Edwards
wept during the whole time of exercise. The people were equally affected;
and, in the afternoon, the power increased yet more.</p>

<p>"Monday, October 20. Left Northampton in the evening, and rode
eighteen miles to Westfield, where I preached next morning to a pretty
large congregation. Hastened to Springfield, crossed a ferry, preached
to a large auditory, and then returned and preached to those who could
not get over the ferry, by reason of the wind. After I left Springfield, my
horse, coming over a broken bridge, threw me over his head, directly upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
my nose. I was stunned for awhile, my mouth was full of dust, and I
bled a little; but, falling upon soft sand, I got not much damage.</p>

<p>"Tuesday, October 21. Preached at Suffield, to several thousands of
people. A great impression was made. I insisted much, in my discourse,
upon the doctrine of the new birth, and also upon the necessity of a
minister being converted before he could preach Christ aright. The
word came with great power, and a general impression was made upon
the people in all parts of the assembly. Many ministers were present,
and most of them thanked me for my plain dealing. One of them, however,
was offended; and so would more of his stamp, if I were to continue
longer in New England. Unconverted ministers are the bane of the
Christian Church. I honour the memory of that great and good man,
Mr. Stoddard; but I think he is much to be blamed for endeavouring to
prove that unconverted men maybe admitted into the ministry. How
he has handled the controversy I know not; but I believe no solid argument
can be brought in defence of such a doctrine. The sermon lately
published by Mr. Gilbert Tennent, entitled, 'The Danger of an Unconverted
Ministry,' I think unanswerable."<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thus ended Whitefield's first visit to Jonathan Edwards
of Northampton. A young lady, <em>née</em> Miss Sarah Pierpont,
but now the wife of Edwards, wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<em>October 24, 1740.</em>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Brother James</span>,&mdash;I want to prepare you for a visit from the
Rev. Mr. Whitefield, the famous preacher of England. He has been
sojourning with us, and, after visiting a few of the neighbouring towns, is
going to New Haven, and from thence to New York. He is truly a remarkable
man, and, during his visit, has, I think, verified all that we have
heard of him. He makes less of the doctrines than our American
preachers generally do, and aims more at affecting the heart. He is a
born orator. You have already heard of his deep-toned, yet clear and
melodious, voice. It is perfect music. It is wonderful to see what a spell
he casts over an audience by proclaiming the simplest truths of the Bible.
I have seen upwards of a thousand people hang on his words with breathless
silence, broken only by an occasional half-suppressed sob. He
impresses the ignorant, and not less the educated and refined. It is
reported that while the miners of England listened to him, the tears made
white furrows down their smutty cheeks. So here, our mechanics shut
up their shops, and the day-labourers throw down their tools, to go and
hear him preach, and few return unaffected. A prejudiced person, I
know, might say that this is all theatrical artifice and display; but not so
will any one think who has seen and known him. He is a very devout and
godly man, and his only aim seems to be to reach and influence men the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
best way. He speaks from a heart all aglow with love, and pours out
a torrent of eloquence which is almost irresistible. I wish him success
in his apostolic career; and, when he reaches New Haven, you will, I
know, shew him warm hospitality.</p>

<p class="sig">
"Yours, in faithful affection,<br />

</p></blockquote>

<p>So much from Jonathan Edwards's wife. What said
Edwards himself? He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Whitefield came to Northampton about the middle of October,
1740, and preached four sermons in the meeting-house. The congregation
was extraordinarily melted by every sermon; almost the whole assembly
being in tears. His sermons were suitable to the circumstances of the
town; containing just reproofs of our backslidings; and, in a most
moving and affecting manner, making use of our great mercies as arguments
with us to return to God, from whom we had departed. Immediately
after this, the minds of the people in general appeared more engaged
in religion. The revival at first was principally among professors, to
whom Mr. Whitefield had chiefly addressed himself; but, in a short
time, there was a deep concern among young persons. By the middle of
December, a very considerable work of God appeared, and the revival
continued to increase."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, at Northampton, as in other places, Whitefield's
visit was the precursor of a religious revival. In this instance,
the work continued for the next two years. Very
often the meeting-house was "full of outcries, faintings, and
convulsions." A great number of children were converted.
Congregations frequently remained, praying and singing, for
hours after the public service was concluded. "The town
seemed to be in a great and continual commotion, day and
night."<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>After parting with Jonathan Edwards, Whitefield proceeded
to New York. At Hertford and Weathersfield, on
October 22, he "preached to many thousands, with much
freedom and power." The day after, he had a congregation
of four thousand at Middletown; and then rode to New
Haven, where, says he, "I was most affectionately received
by Mr. Pierpont, brother to Mr. Edwards of Northampton."
Here he spent three days; and, of course, here he preached.
At one of his services, the governor, the Council, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
members of the Lower House of Assembly formed part of his
congregation. He also dined with "the Rev. Mr. Clap,<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>
Rector of New Haven College, about one-third part as big
as that of Cambridge, and containing about a hundred
students." Here he took the opportunity of "speaking to
the students, and shewing the dreadful ill consequences of
an unconverted ministry;" and, at his lodgings, he collected
£35 for his orphans in Georgia. Leaving New Haven, he
preached at Milford, Stratford, Fairfield, Newark, and Stanford.
On these occasions, many ministers were present, some
of whom confessed they were not converted. Before entering
the province of New York, Whitefield wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have now had an opportunity of seeing the greatest and most populous
part of New England. On many accounts, it certainly exceeds all
other provinces in America; and, for the establishment of religion, perhaps
all other parts of the world. The towns all through Connecticut,
and eastward toward York, in the province of Massachusetts, near the
river-side, are large and well peopled. Every five miles, or perhaps less,
you have a meeting-house; and, I believe, there is no such thing as a
pluralist or non-resident minister in both provinces. God has remarkably,
at sundry times and in divers manners, poured out His Spirit in several
parts; and it often refreshed my soul to hear of the faith of their good
forefathers, who first settled in these parts. Notwithstanding they had
their foibles, surely they were a set of righteous men. Many glorious
men of God have come out of their colleges. The civil government of
New England seems to be well regulated; and, I think, at the opening of
all their courts, either the judge or a minister begins with a prayer.
Family worship, I believe, is generally kept up; and the negroes are
better used than in any other province I have seen. In short, I like New
England exceeding well."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield arrived at New York on Thursday, October
30, and was again the guest of Mr. Noble. Here he spent
four days. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Friday, October 31. Preached in good Mr. Pemberton's meeting-house.
Two or three cried out. Mr. Noble could scarce restrain himself;
and, look where I would, many seemed deeply wounded.</p>

<p>"Saturday, November 1. Preached twice, as yesterday, to very
crowded auditories, and neither time without success.</p>

<p>"Sunday, November 2. Preached in the morning with some freedom.
In the evening, the whole congregation was alarmed. Crying, weeping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
and wailing were to be heard in every corner, and many were to be seen
falling into the arms of their friends.</p>

<p>"Monday, November 3. Preached both morning and afternoon, and
perceived the congregations still increase. There was a great and gracious
melting among the people both times. Near £110 currency was collected
for the orphans; and, in the evening, at seven, we took boat, and
reached Staten Island about ten."</p></blockquote>

<p>For many months, Whitefield had been living and working
in close connection with Presbyterian ministers. Most of
them were ardent admirers of the young evangelist; but
some were critical and distrustful. Hence the publication
of a tract of thirty-two pages, with the following Presbyterian
title: "The Querists; or, an extract of sundry passages
taken out of Mr. Whitefield's printed Sermons, Journals, and
Letters; together with some Scruples proposed in proper
Queries raised on each remark. By some Church Members
of the Presbyterian Persuasion."<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> The "Querists," in their
preface, say, they "are at a loss what to make of some of
Whitefield's expressions; if they have any meaning at all,
we fear it is a bad one." The tract is calmly, but very
keenly written; being, however, purely doctrinal, it is scarcely
necessary to furnish an outline of its contents. Suffice it
to say that Whitefield is treated fairly, though with great
fidelity.</p>

<p>While at New York, Whitefield wrote an answer to the
Querists, which was shortly published.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> It is dated "November
1, 1740." A great part of this production is too minute
to be interesting to the general reader. Whitefield, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
ingenuously confesses there are passages in his printed sermons
that he regrets. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I think it no dishonour to retract some expressions that dropped from
my pen before God was pleased to give me a more clear knowledge of
the doctrines of grace. St. Augustine, I think, did so before me. The
Lord's dealing with me was somewhat out of the common way. I received
the Spirit of adoption before I had conversed with one man, or read
a single book, on the doctrine of 'free justification by the imputed
righteousness of Jesus Christ.' No wonder, then, that I was not so clear
in some points at my first setting out in the ministry. Our Lord was
pleased to enlighten me by degrees; and I desire your prayers, that His
grace may shine more and more in my heart, till it breaks forth into
perfect day."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield then proceeds to notice all the passages in his
sermons to which the "Querists" objected, and adds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And now, to convince you that I am not ashamed to own my faults,
I can inform you of other passages as justly exceptionable. In my sermon
on justification, I seem to assert <em>universal redemption</em>, which I now absolutely
deny. In my 'Almost Christian,' I talk of works <em>procuring</em> us so
high a crown. In my sermon on 'the Marks of the New Birth,' I say,
'We shall endure to the end, <em>if we continue so</em>.' These, and perhaps
some other passages, though capable of a candid interpretation, I now
dislike; and, in the next edition of my sermons, I propose to alter them.
In the meanwhile, I shall be thankful to any that will point out my errors;
and I promise, by Divine assistance, they shall have no reason to say
that I am one who hates to be reformed."</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1739, there was published "An Abstract of the Life
and Death of Mr. Thomas Halyburton;" with a "Recommendatory
Epistle" by Whitefield, and a "Preface" of six
pages by Wesley. In the "Preface," Wesley introduced his
doctrine of Christian perfection; and, because Whitefield's
"Recommendatory Epistle" stood in close connection with
Wesley's "Preface," the "Querists" suspected him of holding
Wesley's doctrine. In reference to this, Whitefield writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As for your insinuating that I countenance Mr. Wesley in his errors,
I do no such thing. I prefaced Halyburton's memoirs before I saw what
Mr. Wesley had written; and, since I have seen it, have more than once
said, 'If I had known what Mr. Wesley had written, I would not have
prefaced Halyburton at all.' I have torn off that part of his preface from
several of those books which I have given away lately, and, by sundry
letters, have acquainted him in what, I think, in this particular, he errs."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield then proceeds to deny the accusation that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
was an Antinomian, and refers to the objections of the
"Querists" concerning his favourable opinion of certain
Quakers to whom he had been introduced; after which he
continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am no friend to casting lots; but I believe, on extraordinary occasions,
when things can be determined no other way, God, if appealed to,
and waited on by prayer and fasting, will answer by lot now, as well as
formerly.</p>

<p>"Do not condemn me for preaching <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extempore</i>, and for saying I am
helped <em>immediately</em> in that exercise; when thousands can prove, as well
as myself, that it has been so. Neither should you censure me as one
that would lay aside reading. I am of Bishop Sanderson's mind, 'Study
without prayer, is atheism; prayer without study, presumption.' Blame
not me for the warmth of some of my adherents, as you call them. One
of your ministers knows how sharply I rebuked one of them, for his
warmth, at Fagg's Manor. I am for loving as brethren, and wish all would
imitate the lowly Jesus; but I cannot discommend those, who, in the
spirit of meekness, exclaim against dry, sapless, unconverted ministers.
Such surely are the bane of the Christian Church.</p>

<p>"Some of the latter part of your queries, for your own, and not for my
sake, I shall not mention. I hope I can say with more sincerity than
Hazael, 'Is your servant a dog, that he should do what you suggest.'
But I pray to God to forgive you. He knows my heart. My one design
is to bring poor souls to Jesus Christ. I desire to avoid extremes, so as
not to be a bigot on the one hand, or confound order and decency on the
other. And I could heartily wish that the reverend Presbytery, when
they advised you to publish your queries, had also cautioned you against
dipping your pen in so much gall."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield's answer to the "Querists" might easily be
criticised; but, except as it reveals his principles and
character, we are inclined to let it pass.</p>

<p>When he left New York on November 3, he proceeded to
Philadelphia, which he reached five days afterwards. On
the way, he preached at Staten Island, Newark, Baskinridge,
New Brunswick, and Trenton. At the first-mentioned place,
his pulpit was a waggon; and, in his congregation, a young
man, in the greatest distress, begged him to pray for his
conversion; and a grey-headed one told him, that, by his
ministry, he had been brought out of darkness into light.
Here also he was met by Gilbert Tennent, and by Mr.
Cross, the minister of Baskinridge. Tennent told him of
his glorious success in West Jersey and in Maryland; and
Cross rejoiced his soul by relating "the great and wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
things" he had recently witnessed in his congregations at
Baskinridge. At Newark, after he had preached, the house,
in which he lodged, was filled with young men, all weeping
for their sins. At Baskinridge, he had a crowd of three
thousand people. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In every part of the congregation, some one or other began to cry
out, and almost all were melted into tears. A little boy, about eight years
of age, wept as though his heart would break. Mr. Cross took him up
into the waggon, which so affected me, that I broke from my discourse,
and told the people that, since old professors were not concerned, God,
out of an infant's mouth, was perfecting praise; and the little boy should
preach to them. After sermon, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; gave notice of an evening lecture
in his barn. Mr. Gilbert Tennent preached first; and I then began to
pray, and gave an exhortation. In about six minutes, one cried out, 'He
is come, He is come!' and could scarce sustain the manifestation of
Jesus to his soul. The eager crying of others, for the like favour, obliged
me to stop; and I prayed over them, as I saw their agonies and distress
increase. Most of the people spent the remainder of the night in prayer
and praises."</p></blockquote>

<p>At New Brunswick, Whitefield received encouraging letters
from Savannah, and wrote: "I resolved to give up the
Savannah living. A parish and the Orphan House, which
I must travel to provide for, as well as to preach, are too
much for me." Here, also, he and Gilbert and William
Tennent had prayer together, and arranged that Gilbert
should go and help to carry on the work of God at Boston.
"We parted in tears," says Whitefield; "but with a full
assurance that we should see and hear great things before
we met again."</p>

<p>Before proceeding farther, extracts from Whitefield's letters
must be introduced. They were all written within two days
after his arrival at Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The following was addressed to the Honourable Jonathan
Belcher, Governor of New England, and refers to Gilbert
Tennent's mission, just mentioned:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I snatch a few moments to send your excellency my acknowledgments
for all the honours received at Boston; they are much upon my heart.
Great things hath the glorious Emmanuel done for me and His people on
the way here. The word has been attended with much power. Surely
our Lord intends to set America in a flame. This week, Mr. Gilbert
Tennent purposes to set out for Boston, in order to blow up the fire lately
kindled there. I recommend him to your excellency as a solid, judicious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
and zealous minister of the Lord Jesus Christ. He will be ready to preach
daily. I suppose his brethren" (the Presbyterians) "will readily open
their doors. May the Lord, at the same time, open the people's hearts,
that they may diligently attend to the things that shall be spoken!</p>

<p>"Dear sir, the welfare of your own soul lies upon me night and day. I
remember your tears; I remember your excellency's words, 'Mr. Whitefield,
pray that I may hunger and thirst after righteousness.' O how did
these words rejoice me! May God give you to see and follow the simplicity
of the blessed Jesus! Whilst you are in the world, may you not
be of it! May you be dead to magnificence, and alive to nothing but
what leads you directly to your God! Honoured sir, I make no apology
for this freedom. Your excellency bid me not spare rulers; no, not the
chief of them. Indeed, I long after your salvation. O that I could do
anything to promote it!"</p></blockquote>

<p>To another friend, Whitefield wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I arrived at this place" (Philadelphia) "last Saturday evening, having
preached at Staten Island, Newark, Baskinridge, New Brunswick, and
Trenton, in my way hither from New York. A wonderful presence of
God was observable at New York, Baskinridge, and Newark. I preached
here twice yesterday, and also to-day, in a large house built by the people
since I was here last. The Lord highly favours me. I am more sick, of
myself, and more in love with Christ daily. He is a dear, dear Master.
O that all would love Him with all their hearts!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Writing to Howell Harris, Whitefield exultingly remarks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My soul is knit to you. We both speak and think the same things.
Jesus manifests His glory daily in these parts. His word is like fire.
Last week I saw many struck down. Our Lord is working upon little
children. America, ere long, will be famous for Christians. Surely the
candlestick will shortly be removed from England. Little did I think,
when Mr. E&mdash;&mdash; J&mdash;&mdash; wrote, that I should preach in all the chief places of
America; but that is now done. Glory be to rich, free, sovereign grace!
Perhaps, about spring, I may embark for my native country. O Wales,
thou art dear to my soul! Expect another journal shortly; but wait till
we come to glory, fully to see and hear what God has done for your
affectionate brother,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>It was a mournful thing that almost the only one to
whom Whitefield wrote complaining letters was his old
friend Wesley. The following, though published elsewhere,
is too interesting to be omitted. It was written on Sunday,
the day after Whitefield's arrival at Philadelphia.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<em>November 9, 1740.</em>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear and honoured Sir</span>,&mdash;I received yours, dated March 11, this
afternoon. O that we were of one mind! for I am yet persuaded you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
greatly err. You have set a mark you will never arrive at, till you come
to glory. I think few enjoy such continued manifestations of God's presence
as I do, and have done for some years; but I dare not pretend to
say I shall be absolutely perfect.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Oh, dear sir, many of God's children
are grieved at your principles. O that God may give you a sight of His
free, sovereign, electing love!</p>

<p>"But no more of this. Why will you compel me to write thus? Why
will you dispute? I am willing to go with you to prison and to death;
but I am not willing to oppose you. My heart is now much affected.
Indeed, I love and honour you. Dear, dear sir, study the covenant of
grace, that you may be consistent with yourself. I fancy I shall embark
for England about spring; but am not yet determined. God shews me
His goodness plenteously every day. I dwell in Christ, and Christ dwells
in me. Glory be to sovereign grace! I seem to have a new body, and
the Lord Jesus greatly enriches my soul. Oh! I am a poor sinner; but
our Lord frequently manifests Himself in such a manner, that it throws
me into an agony which my body is almost too weak to bear. Honoured
sir, adieu! Oh, build up, but do not lead into error, the souls once committed
to the charge of your affectionate, unworthy brother and servant
in the loving Jesus,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>We return to Whitefield's Journals. The young evangelist
spent a successful and happy week among his friends
in Philadelphia. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sunday, November 9. Preached in the morning, to several thousands,
in a house built since my last departure from Philadelphia. It is a hundred
feet long, and seventy feet broad. It was never preached in before.
The roof is not yet up; but the people raised a convenient pulpit, and
boarded the bottom."<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>During the ensuing week, he preached in this roofless
building twice every day, except one morning, when there
was so much snow within the walls, that he was obliged to
avail himself of a Presbyterian meeting-house. On Sunday,
November 16, after his morning and evening sermons, he
collected £150 sterling for his orphans; and, in the afternoon,
baptized, in the unconsecrated edifice, five adult women.
During his sojourn, he met Mr. Brockden, Recorder of Deeds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
an infidel, upwards of sixty years old, who had been converted
by his preaching, and who told him that now, "such
were his communications from God, he thought he could die
a martyr for the truth." Another of Whitefield's converts
was a Captain H&mdash;&mdash;l, formerly, says Whitefield, "almost a
scandal and reproach to human nature. He used to swear
to ease his stomach, and used to go on board the transport
ships, and offer a guinea for every new oath" that the sailors
had invented. "Now," writes Whitefield, "he is zealous for
the truth, and shews forth his faith by his works."</p>

<p>There cannot be a doubt that Whitefield's preaching in
Philadelphia was not only immensely popular, but also
greatly blessed. He tells us, that, almost every day many
were convinced of sin; and that several Societies had been
formed, "not only of men and women, but of little boys and
little girls."</p>

<p>On Monday, November 17, he bid adieu to his Philadelphian
friends, and started for Savannah. On the way, he
preached, as usual, to assembled thousands, at Gloucester,
Greenwich, Piles Grove, Cohansie, Salem, Newcastle, Whiteclay
Creek, Fagg's Manor, Nottingham, Bohemia, St. George's,
Reedy Island, and Charleston. He arrived at Savannah
on Saturday, December 13. He had been absent from
his parishioners eighteen weeks, had travelled about a
thousand miles, preached nearly two hundred times, and
collected, in goods and money, upwards of £700 sterling for
his Orphanage.</p>

<p>The following extracts from his letters will, it is hoped,
interest the reader.</p>

<p>One of the places at which he preached, on his way to
Georgia, was the Moravian settlement, called Salem; and
here he seems to have met Peter Bohler. Hence the
following to James Hutton, the distinguished Moravian in
London:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Bohemia, Maryland</span>, <em>November 24, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My very dear Brother</span>,&mdash;I rejoice to hear that you are married.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>
I salute your wife and my sister in Christ. May you love one another as
Christ and His Church!</p>

<p>"I have lately conversed closely with Peter Bohler. Alas! we differ
widely in many respects; therefore, to avoid disputations and jealousies
on both sides, it is best to carry on the work of God apart. The divisions
among the Brethren<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> sometimes grieve, but do not surprise me. How
can it be otherwise, when teachers do not think and speak the same
things? O how do I long for heaven! Surely, there will be no divisions,
no strife <em>there</em>, except who shall sing with most affection to the Lamb that
sitteth upon the throne. Dear James, there I hope to meet thee; for the
dear Jesus, I believe, has locked thee fast in His almighty arms. Lean
thou on His sacred bosom night and day. Keep close to Him, and be,
what I long to be, a little child. My dear brother, I should be glad to
wash any of the Brethren's feet. Indeed, I am now willing to be the
servant of all. The more the Lord honours me, the more I feel my unworthiness.
Help me, dear James, to praise my Saviour. A glorious
church is rising in America. The Lord mightily reveals His arm. It
would please you to see His stately steps in the great congregation. I
only want fellow-labourers.</p>

<p>"I desire you to print nothing against your conscience; only do not
immediately censure everything that may not seem clear to you. Our
Lord may guide me into things which as yet you may not see into. The
day of judgment will discover all. Adieu!</p>

<p class="sig">
"Ever, ever yours in our blessed Emmanuel,<br />

"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield made himself one with all who loved his
Master&mdash;Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Moravians, Baptists,
Independents, and even Quakers. "Give none offence,"
wrote the great Apostle, "neither to the Jews, nor to the
Gentiles, nor to the Church of God. Even as I please all
men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit
of many, that they may be saved" (1 Cor. x. 32, 33).</p>

<p>The last paragraph in Whitefield's letter refers to the
fact that Hutton had been Whitefield's publisher. Whitefield
now, however, had become such a decided Calvinist, that
Hutton's conscience began to trouble him for printing and
circulating doctrines which he disbelieved; and when Whitefield
returned to England, a few months afterwards, one of
the distresses awaiting him was Hutton's absolute refusal to
publish any of his writings. He was losing the services of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
James Hutton on the ground of a difference in religious
opinion; but, at the same time, he was securing the services
of Benjamin Franklin, the printer and publisher at Philadelphia,
to whom religious opinions were of no great consequence.
The following was addressed to Franklin two days
after the letter sent to Hutton:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Reedy Island</span>, <em>November 26, 1740</em>.

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Franklin</span>,&mdash;I thank you for your letter. You may print
my life,<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> as you desire. God willing, I shall correct my two volumes of
Sermons,<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> and send them the very first opportunity. Pray write to me by
every ship that goes shortly to Charleston.</p>

<p>"I shall embark for England, God willing, about February. I desire
I may hear from you there also, as often as possible. I have prefaced
'<em>Jenks</em>' and 'Presumptuous Sinners Detected.' Mr. Bradford has the
latter, because he said he was to print it. You may have it of him. The
'Ornaments of the Daughter of Sion'<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> you may have hereafter.</p>

of Christianity. Apply to God; be willing to do the Divine will, and you
shall know it. Oh! the love of God to your unworthy friend,</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield's tour through the British provinces of America
had been a triumphal progress; but, after all, his happiness
was not unmixed. He had come under the animadversion
of certain ministers and members of the Presbyterian Church.
He was full of anxiety concerning the "<em>stillness</em>" and contentions
of the London Moravians. And, of course, the
doctrinal differences between him and his old friend Wesley
occasioned great disquietude. The following is another of
the letters that passed between them:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Bohemia, Maryland</span>, <em>November 24, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear and honoured Sir</span>,&mdash;O that there may be harmony, and
very intimate union between us! Yet it cannot be, since you hold <em>universal
redemption</em>. But no more of this. Perhaps, in the spring, we may see
each other face to face. This evening, I propose to embark for Georgia.
Wonderful things our Lord brings to pass, in these parts, every day.
Here is a close opposition from some of the Presbyterian clergy. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
seed of the serpent is the same in all, of whatever communion. I expect
much more opposition every hour. The devil rages in London. He
begins now to triumph indeed. The children of God are disunited
among themselves. The King of the Church shall yet over-rule all
things for good. My dear brother, for Christ's sake, avoid all disputation.
Do not oblige me to preach against you; I had rather die. Be gentle
towards the" (Moravians?) "They will get great advantage over you if
they discover any irregular warmth in your temper. I cannot for my soul
unite with them.</p>

<p class="sig">
"Honoured sir, adieu.<br />
"Yours eternally in Christ Jesus,<br />
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Wesley shrunk from disputation as much as Whitefield
did. It is true, he had published his sermon entitled "Free
Grace;" but it contained no mention of the name of his
friend Whitefield. Wesley was ready to wage war with
error, but not with his brother "George." The last letter
which Whitefield had received from Wesley was the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>August 9, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"My dear Brother</span>,&mdash;I thank you for yours, May the 24th.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> The
case is quite plain. There are bigots both for predestination and against
it. God is sending a message to those on either side. But neither will
receive it, unless from one of his own opinion. Therefore, for a time, you
are suffered to be of one opinion, and I of another. But when His time
is come, God will do what man cannot&mdash;namely, make us both of one
mind. Then persecution will flame out, and it will be seen whether we
count our lives dear unto ourselves, so that we may finish our course with
joy.</p>

<p class="sig">
"I am, my dearest brother, ever yours,<br />
"<span class="smcap">John Wesley</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield's reply to this was dated "Bethesda in Georgia,
December 24, 1740;" but more of this anon.</p>

<p>On his arrival in Georgia, Whitefield found his family
removed, from his "hired house" in Savannah, to his newly
erected Orphanage at Bethesda. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At my return, I found my orphan household removed from Savannah
to Bethesda, and great improvements made during the time of my absence.
The great house will be finished, God willing, in about two months. It
would have been finished by this time, if the Spaniards had not taken a
schooner laden with bricks and other provisions to a considerable value;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
but God, about the same time, stirred up the heart of a planter in South
Carolina, lately converted at the Orphan House, to send my family some
rice and bread. At other times, when they have wanted food, the Indians
have brought plenty of venison. My family now consists of above eighty
persons. Next year my expenses will be much contracted; but at present
I am in debt about £500 sterling. However, I know in whom I have
believed&mdash;One who is able to pay it. My public accounts will be published
as soon as I arrive in London, with a prospect of the Orphan
House and other little houses and gardens annexed unto it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield's "public accounts" were printed with the
following title: "An Account of the Money received and
disbursed for the Orphan House in Georgia. By George
Whitefield, A.B., late of Pembroke College, Oxford. London,
1741." (8vo. 45 pp.) The following is taken from his own
published narrative:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When I left England, I proposed to take in only twenty children;
but, when I arrived in Georgia, I found, besides the orphans, so many
objects of charity among the poor people's children, that I resolved in this,
as well as in all other respects, to imitate Professor Francke, and make a
provision for <em>their</em> maintenance also.</p>

<p>"Two of the boys were put out apprentices just before I left Savannah,
one to a bricklayer, another to a carpenter; a third is to be bound to the
surgeon belonging to the Orphan House; one weaves in a loom at home;
two I put to a tailor, whom I brought over; and the rest are now fitting
themselves to be useful to the commonwealth. Whoever among them
appear to be sanctified, and have a good natural capacity, I intend, under
God, for the ministry.</p>

<p>"None of the girls are put out as yet, but are taught such things as may
make them serviceable whenever they go abroad. Two or three of them
spin very well. Some of them knit, wash, and clean the house, and get
up the linen, and are taught housewifery. All capable are taught to sew;
and the little girls, as well as the boys, are employed in picking cotton. I
think I have no less than three hundred and eighty-two yards of cloth
already in the house, and as much yarn spun as will make the same
quantity.</p>

<p>"I have now forty-nine children under my care; twenty-three English,
ten Scots, four Dutch, five French, and seven Americans. Twenty-two of
these are fatherless and motherless, sixteen boys and six girls. Of the
others, some are fatherless, and some without mothers; all objects of
charity, except three, whose friends recompense the Orphan House for their
maintenance. One of the orphans is an infant. I pay four shillings a
week for nursing it. Since December last, we have had eighteen more
children who have been maintained occasionally, to assist their parents,
and been dismissed when they were wanted at home.</p>

<p>"Though the children are taught to labour for the meat that perisheth,
yet they are continually reminded, to seek <em>first</em> the kingdom of God and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
His righteousness, and then to depend upon God's blessing on their honest
endeavours for having food and raiment added unto them. I intend,
when the house is finished, to have this precept of our Lord written over
the entrance at the great door.</p>

<p>"As my design in founding the Orphan House was to build up souls for
God, I endeavour to preach most of all to the children's hearts. But that
they may be able to give a reason of the hope that is in them, I constantly
instruct them out of the Church of England's Articles, which I turn into
catechetical questions. I am often pleased to hear how judiciously some
will answer the questions put to them. The power of God has been
frequently visible among them. Many of the girls seem to be tender-hearted.
Several of the boys have been under strong convictions.</p>

<p>"We are now all removed to Bethesda. We live in the out-houses at
present; but, in less than two months, the great house will be finished
so as to receive the whole family. It is now weather-boarded and shingled;
and a piazza of ten feet wide is built all around it, which will be wonderfully
convenient in the heat of summer. One part of the house would
have been entirely finished, had not the Spaniards lately taken from us a
schooner laden with ten thousand bricks, and a great deal of provision,
with one of our family. But, notwithstanding this and many other hindrances,
the work has been carried on with great success and speed. There
are no less than four framed houses, and a large stable and cart-house,
besides the great house. In that, there will be sixteen commodious rooms,
besides a large cellar of sixty feet long and forty wide. Near twenty acres of
land are cleared round about it, and a large road made from Savannah to
the Orphan House, twelve miles in length&mdash;a thing not before done since
the province has been settled.</p>

<p>"None but those on the spot can tell the expense, as well as inconveniency,
that attends building in Georgia. Most of our bricks cost forty
shillings sterling per thousand, when landed at the plantation. Common
labourers, besides their provisions, have twenty-five shillings sterling a
month. We have often been in difficulties; but the Lord has relieved us
out of them. When the schooner was lost, a person, lately converted,
sent us eleven barrels of rice, and five barrels of beef. And, in my absence,
when my family had little or no provisions, the Indians brought in plenty
of deer, till they were supplied with food some other way. The contributions
in Charleston, New England, New York, and Pennsylvania have
been extraordinary.</p>

<p>The Infirmary, which has likewise been supported by this institution,
has been of great service. The surgeon informs me, that, if every one had
been obliged to pay for their nursing and medicine, it would have cost
them £200 sterling. I have now three or four sick. I keep a woman to
attend them constantly.</p>

<p>"God has blessed our family with health. Only two have died since
my arrival; and those were two who came with me from England,&mdash;the
tailor, and one of the women.</p>

<p>"I have left behind me, as my assistants (who have no other gratuity
than food and raiment), two schoolmasters, and their wives, who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
schoolmistresses; one young man, as superintendent and chief manager
of the outward things; the surgeon, and his wife; a shoemaker, and a
spinster; besides labourers and monthly-hired servants: I think, in all,
I have upwards of eighty. The Lord, I am persuaded, is able and willing
to provide for them.</p>

<p>"I think we have near two hundred hogs, and a hundred head of cattle.
I give a man £40 sterling per annum, to take care of them. As yet, we
have had no advantage from our stock, it being a very dry season last
summer; so that our cattle of all kinds have scarce food to eat. But, in
a year or two, we hope to have a considerable quantity of fresh provisions
for our family.</p>

<p>"As for manuring more land than the hired servants and great boys
can manage, I think it is impracticable without a few negroes. It will in
no wise answer the expense.</p>

<p>"I am now several hundreds of pounds in debt, on the Orphan-house
account. Some particular friends have been pleased to assist me; and
I doubt not but our Lord will enable me to pay them, and also will raise
up fresh subscriptions for the maintenance of my large family.</p>

<p>"Great calumnies have been spread abroad concerning our management
of the children. People shoot out their bitter arrows in America, as well
as in England. One poor man was filled with such resentment at the
reports he had heard of our cruelty to the children, that he came one day,
out of South Carolina, to take away two of his boys, which, out of compassion,
I had taken into the Orphan House; but when he came, and saw
the manner in which they were educated, he was so far from taking his
children away, that he desired to come and live at the Orphan House
himself. I speak not this by way of boasting, or to wipe off reproach;
for I know, let me do what I will, I shall never please natural men.</p>

<p>"God only knows the concern that lies upon me on account of this
family, not only in respect to their bodily, but their spiritual provision.
I hope all who wish well to Zion will help me with their prayers, as well
as with their alms, that the establishment may be rightly styled <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pietas
Georgiensis</i>, and that, like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pietas Hallensis</i>, it may become the joy of
the whole earth. Even so, Lord Jesus, Amen, and Amen.</p>

<p>
"<em>Bethesda, December 23, 1740.</em>"
</p></blockquote>

<p>On a small scale, comparatively, Whitefield was endeavouring
to imitate one of the most surprising institutions in Europe,
the orphanage of Professor Francke, at Halle, in Germany.
The "plan of elevation" of his "great house," as he calls it, is
before us. The building, with a high roof, and belfry at the
top, and also a colonnade all round about, consisted, first, of
the large cellar already mentioned, and also "Mr. Whitefield's
kitchen." On the ground floor, the entrance hall was a chapel;
on the left was the library, and behind it the "orphan's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
dining-room;" on the right, "Mr. Whitefield's two parlours,"
with the staircase between them. On the second and third
floors were "Mr. Whitefield's study" and "Mr. Whitefield's
chamber;" the "manager's room;" two "bed-chambers" for
the boys; the same for the girls; and five other chambers
for general use. Behind the house was "Salt Water Creek,"
and at the front were the "peach orchard" and the gardens.
Extending right and left, was the Orphan House estate,
measuring five hundred acres, a large portion of it covered
with oaks, pines, and hickory trees; a considerable portion
consisting of swamps and marshes; and the remainder
marked "good rice land." Considering the scarcity of labour,
and the unfitness of Europeans for outdoor work in such a
climate, it is hardly surprising that Whitefield began to see
it would be "impracticable" to cultivate his land without
the services of "<em>a few negroes</em>."</p>

<p>Whitefield's "great house" was, in reality, an orphanage,
an infirmary, and a poor house all in one. Up to the
present, it had cost him £3,358 7s. 5<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>4</small></sub>d. Towards
this amount, he had received, in England and America,
£2,530 2s. 9d.;<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> to which must be added a large number of
valuable gifts in kind, embracing horses, hogs, sheep, geese,
turkeys, and a cow; furniture, books, linen, crockery, glass,
bricks, nails, pewter spoons, and a cannon; rice, butter,
cheese, hams, sugar-loaves, coffee, tea, chocolate, pickles,
candles, beef, treacle, pease, and flour; and "a large folio
Turkey-leather Bible."</p>

<p>How did the young preacher regulate his large family?
Fortunately, this is a question which can be answered. From
a pamphlet, entitled "The Manner of the Children's spending
their Time at the Orphan House in Georgia," it appears,
that the children had to rise every morning at five o'clock,
and that their first employment was to spend a quarter of
an hour in private prayer. At six, all the family assembled
in the chapel where a psalm was sung, and the second
lesson for the morning expounded by Whitefield; or, if he
were absent, in lieu of the exposition, the manager read
Burkitt's or Matthew Henry's notes. At seven, Ken's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
morning hymn was sung, and extempore prayer offered.
Between seven and eight, the children had their breakfast;
and, at intervals, sang hymns. From eight to ten, they were
employed at carding, spinning, picking cotton or wool, sewing,
and knitting. Some had to clean the house, others to fetch
water, and others to cut wool. Certain of the boys were
"placed under tailors, shoemakers, carpenters," etc. At ten,
all went to school, some to reading, and some to writing.
At noon, all of them dined in the same room together;
"and between that and two o'clock, every one was employed
in something useful, but <em>no time</em> was allowed for <em>idleness or
play</em>, which are <em>Satan's darling hours to tempt children to all
manner of wickedness</em>, as lying, cursing, swearing, and uncleanness;
so that," continues the writer, "though we are
about seventy in family, we hear no more noise than if it
was a private house." From two to four, the children were
again at school; and from four to six, at work. At six, they
had supper, and singing. At seven, all the family assembled
in the chapel, where a service was held similar to that at six
in the morning. At eight, Whitefield catechised the children.
At nine, they had some slight refreshment, and prepared for
bed, each child, in private, again praying for a quarter of an
hour. On Sundays, there were four public services, and "all
the family dined on cold meat." There was "but one purse
in the house, none having any other wages than food and
raiment convenient for them."</p>

<p>The Orphan House now really became Whitefield's parish.
To watch over it, and to provide for its necessities, furnished
him with as much work as he felt at liberty to undertake.
He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1740. Monday, December 29. Enjoyed a very comfortable Christmas
at Bethesda. One woman, I trust, received Christ in a glorious manner;
and several others were brought under strong convictions. Having
appointed Mr. Barber,<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> who came with me from Rhode Island, to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
care of the spiritual, and Mr. Habersham to superintend the outward
affairs of the Orphan House, and settled all things to my satisfaction; and
being called by Providence, on various accounts, to return to England, I,
last night, took a sorrowful and affectionate leave of my family, and this
day went to Savannah to take leave there. In the evening, I preached at
Savannah, and took my final leave of the people, it being inconsistent
with my other affairs to act as their pastor any longer. Another minister
is not yet come, but is expected daily. I gave the trustees notice, in
January last, of my design to give up the parsonage. Blessed be God! I
am now more free to go whithersoever the Lord shall be pleased to call
me. I yet hope well of Georgia, though, at present, it is in a very
declining and piteous state. It will flourish, I believe, when settled upon
a religious foundation. Glory be to God! I leave behind me some who
love the Lord Jesus in sincerity."<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>No doubt, Georgia was in a "piteous state." The
Spaniards of Florida were harassing the province; and
Oglethorpe was doing his utmost to resist and punish them.
To some extent, he had succeeded, but certain malcontents,
in Savannah, were as busy as the Spaniards in endeavouring
to ruin the colony. These men, under the leadership of a
Doctor Tailfer, formed themselves into a club, which met at
the house of one Jenkins, where they concocted the vilest
machinations against Oglethorpe. Their object was to
reduce the colony into such weakness and insignificance as
to compel the trustees to gratify their desires for slaves and
spirituous liquors, so that they might indulge to the extent
of their wishes in idleness and dissipation. Tailfer and
Williamson&mdash;the successful rival of John Wesley&mdash;hoped,
by their agitation, to obtain a monopoly of the trade in
negroes; and, because they were disappointed in their expectation,
resorted to the most malicious and revengeful acts.
To disturb the quiet of Savannah, they instituted races
<em>within</em> the town, from the gate of the Public Garden to the
middle of Johnson's Square. They hired the most miserable
hacks, and, by drink, obtained riders to contribute to their
mischievous diversion;&mdash;the members of Tailfer's club being
the principal betting men. Besides this, they published
scurrilous pamphlets, one of which was sarcastically dedicated
"To his Excellency James Oglethorpe." The writer, in his
address to Oglethorpe, sneeringly remarks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You have protected us from ourselves, by keeping all earthly comforts
from us. You have afforded us the opportunity of arriving at the integrity
of primitive times, by entailing a more than primitive poverty upon us.
The valuable virtue of humanity is secured to us by your care to prevent
our procuring, or so much as seeing, any negroes (the only creatures
proper to improve the soil), lest our simplicity might mistake the poor
Africans for greater slaves than ourselves. And, that we might fully
receive the benefit of those wholesome austerities, you have denied us the
use of spirituous liquors, which might at least divert our minds from the
contemplation of our happy circumstances."</p></blockquote>

<p>From an early period, Tailfer had been turbulent, and
his daily employment had been to misrepresent the public
measures, disperse scandal, and incite discontent. At length,
a short time before Whitefield left, Tailfer's club was dissolved;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
and the doctor and his crew migrated to Charleston.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
"The fear of the Spaniards," says Stephens, "was what
drove them away."</p>

<p>This account conveys an unfavourable idea of the
state of Whitefield's parish&mdash;a parish, however, to which
he had devoted but little service. Three years had elapsed
since Whitefield had first embarked for Savannah. Ever
since, he had been the nominal incumbent; and yet, during
this whole period, he had spent only twenty-nine weeks and
two days in the province of Georgia; Savannah, Frederica,
Bethesda, and other places all included. Perhaps, if the
parson had been more with his people, the demagogues,
Tailfer, Williamson, and their gang, might have been less
mischievous than they were. At all events, the tie between
Whitefield and Savannah had been so slender, that there
could be no great wrench when the young incumbent relinquished
his living.</p>

<p>Whitefield left Savannah on New Year's Day, 1741; and
arrived at Charleston on Sunday, January 4. Here he
spent nearly the next fortnight. He preached twice every
day, besides expounding in the evenings; and, as usual
when at Charleston, he got into trouble. A Mr. Hugh
Bryan<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> had written a letter, "in which it was hinted that
the clergy break their canons." At the writer's request,
Whitefield revised the letter for the press. The letter was
published. Immediately Mr. Bryan was arrested; and,
on being questioned, confessed that Whitefield corrected the
letter, and made alterations in it. Upon this, on Saturday,
January 11, a constable came to Whitefield with a warrant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
addressed "To all and singular the Constables of Charleston,"
to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Whereas I have received information upon oath, that George Whitefield,
clerk, hath made and composed a false, malicious, scandalous, and
infamous libel against the clergy of this province, in contempt of His
Majesty and his laws, and against the King's peace;</p>

<p>"These are, therefore, in His Majesty's name, to charge and command
you and each of you forthwith to apprehend the said George Whitefield,
and to bring him before me to answer the premisses. Hereof fail not, at
your peril. And for your so doing, this shall be your and each of your
sufficient warrant.</p>

<p>"Given under my hand and seal this 10th day of January, in the
fourteenth year of his Majesty's reign, Anno Domini, 1741.</p>

<p class="sig">
"B&mdash;&mdash; W&mdash;&mdash;."
</p></blockquote>

<p>On receiving such a formidably-worded document, Whitefield
appeared before the magisterial magnates, confessed
that he had corrected Mr. Bryan's letter for the press, and
gave security to appear, by his attorney, at the next general
quarter sessions, "under the penalty of £100 proclamation
money."</p>

<p>This was on Saturday; and, as shewing that much of
Whitefield's pulpit eloquence was impromptu, it may be
added, that, next morning, he preached "upon Herod's
sending the wise men to find out Christ, under a pretence
that he intended to come and <em>worship</em> Him, when in reality
he intended to <em>kill</em> Him." From this, Whitefield "endeavoured
to shew how dreadful it was to persecute under a
pretence of <em>religion</em>."</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the young preacher's text was more
pointed still: "They proclaimed a fast; and set Naboth
on high among the people, and there came in two men,
children of Belial, and sat before him; and the men of
Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the
presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God
and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city,
and stoned him with stones, that he died" (1 Kings xxi.
12, 13). "My hearers," writes Whitefield, "as well as
myself, made the application. It was pretty close. I especially
directed my discourse to men of authority, and shewed
them the heinous sin of abusing the power which God hath
put into their hands."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>

<p>Whitefield was as much beloved by the populace of
Charleston as he was hated by its "authorities and powers."
He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"January 16, Friday. Preached twice every day this week, and expounded
in the evening as usual. Congregations much increased since
Saturday night last; and I never received such generous tokens of love
from any people as from some in Charleston. They so loaded me with
sea-stores, that I sent many of them to Savannah. Having now all
things finished according to my mind, I preached my farewell sermon last
night, and spoke at the burial of a Quaker woman, at the desire of her
surviving friends. I this day went on board the <em>Minerva</em>, Captain
Meredith, in which I took passage for myself and some others to England."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield arrived in England on the 11th of March
following; but, before attending him in his voyage, some
other matters must be noticed.</p>

<p>Nearly a year and a half had elapsed since his embarkation
for America. His time had been occupied to the
utmost; and marvellous had been the results of his evangelistic
labours. The same may be said of his friends,
John and Charles Wesley. Charles had been in Whitefield's
native county, preaching, in the fields, to assembled
thousands. In Bristol and Kingswood, enormous crowds
had attended his ministry, and great numbers had been
converted. Often did he meet with persons who had been
convinced of sin by Whitefield's preaching; and sincerely
he rejoiced on account of his friend's success. He had
visited the native place of William Seward, and had been
treated by some of the Seward family with the greatest
incivility. In London he had preached, not only in the
Foundery, but, on Kennington Common, and in other places
where Whitefield had been wont to lift up his trumpet
voice. He had had to fight the Moravians, or rather their
errors; and had been honestly assisted by Benjamin Ingham
and Howell Harris; but of "Rabbi Hutton," as he calls
Whitefield's publisher, he says: "Poor James was all tergiversation.
O how unlike himself! The honest, plain,
undesigning Jacob is now turned a subtle, close, ambiguous
Loyola."</p>

<p>John Wesley had converted the old Foundery, in London,
into a Methodist meeting-house. He and Philip Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
Molther had had a passage at arms. Many of the Moravians
considered him an apostate; but others followed him
from Fetter Lane to the now ecclesiastical Foundery, where,
on July 23, 1740, he formed them into the first Methodist
Society in London. In Bristol and Kingswood, he had
witnessed strange things, amply narrated in his "Journals,"
and in his "Life and Times." The interval which had
elapsed since Whitefield embarked for America, had been a
time of warfare and of trial; but it had also been a time of
triumph. Wesley had laid the foundation of the great
Methodist communities now existing; but what of Whitefield?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is a remarkable fact, that, considering the sparseness of the American
population, the crowds attending Whitefield's preaching were, perhaps,
unparalleled in the history of the Church of Christ. There is also
another important fact which it would be obstinacy to call in question,
namely, that among the Presbyterians, Independents, and Baptists of
America, Whitefield's ministry had been immensely useful; and, further,
that, from the outside multitudes, he had gathered not a few into the fold
of Christ. But, notwithstanding his marvellous popularity and success,
Whitefield formed no societies of his own in America. He was not there,
as the founder of a sect. God seems to have sent him, not to plant new
churches; but, by preaching the gospel, to revive old ones. For the
former, he had no tact; for the latter, his qualifications were extraordinary.
He formed no churches of his own; and yet his Herculean labours were
far from being lost. The labours of no one man, save those of Wesley
alone, (and even those only indirectly,) have exerted so mighty an influence
upon the religious interests and destiny of America, as those of
George Whitefield."</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Abel Stevens, whose knowledge of American Church
history is, perhaps, unequalled, observes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Congregational Churches of New England, the Presbyterians and
Baptists of the Middle States, and the mixed colonies of the South, owe
their later religious life and energy mostly to the impulse given by Whitefield's
powerful ministrations. The 'great awakening' under Edwards had
not only subsided before Whitefield's arrival, but had reacted. Whitefield
restored it; and the New England Churches received under his labours an
inspiration of zeal and energy which has never died out. He extended the
revival from the Congregational Churches of the Eastern to the Presbyterian
Churches of the Middle States. In Pennsylvania and New Jersey,
where Frelinghuysen, Blair, Rowland, and the two Tennents had been
labouring with evangelical zeal, he was received as a prophet from God;
and it was then that the Presbyterian Church took that attitude of evangelical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
power and aggression which has ever since characterised it. Whitefield's
preaching, and especially the reading of his printed sermons in
Virginia, led to the founding of the Presbyterian Church in that State,
whence it has extended to the South and South-west. The stock, from
which the Baptists of Virginia and those in all the south and south-west
have sprung, was also Whitefieldian. And, though Whitefield did not
organise the results of his labours, he prepared the way for Wesley's
itinerants. When he descended into his American grave, they were already
on his track. They came not only to labour, but to organise their
labours; to reproduce, amid the peculiar moral necessities of the new
world, both the spirit and method of the great movement as it had been
organised by Wesley in the old."<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Excepting the legal proceedings taken against him at
Charleston, Mr. Garden's letters, and the not ill-tempered
animadversions of the "Querists" in Philadelphia, Whitefield
had encountered no opposition in America worth mentioning;
but, in England, he was still "an astonishment, a
proverb, and a byword," to his enemies. Among the
numerous pamphlets and other publications, in which he was
more or less criticised and abused, the following may be
mentioned. His unwise letter against Archbishop Tillotson
gave birth to "The Sentiments of Archbishops Tillotson
and Sharp on Regeneration; and of Bishop Moor, etc., on
Justification by Faith only. Recommended to the perusal
of the more serious and considerate Followers of Mr. Whitefield.
With a Preface, wherein is represented the evil tendencies
of his Principles and Conduct, both to Civil Society
and the Christian Religion. By a Friend of True Religion."
(8vo. 47 pp.)</p>

<p>The sting of this pamphlet is in its preface, of fourteen
pages; which begins by stating, that, the social duties of
man cannot "be reconciled with such daily fasting, praying,
frequent preaching, and strict austerities of life as our
<em>modern religious</em>, the sanctified Mr. Whitefield and his
proselytes, seem to practise themselves and recommend to
others. As God thought proper to appoint but one day in
seven to be dedicated to His own more immediate service,
how presumptuous is it for any one to alter the rule and order
of God, by taking from their labour the industrious two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
three hours in a day (perhaps more) to attend on prayer and
preaching! It would be well if this <em>modern religious</em>, this
person of great sanctity and more peculiar holiness, would
seriously consider how much his diurnal aerial preaching,
and <em>new method</em> of recommending practical religion, tend to
injure public society and private families; to destroy trade
and commerce; to occasion riot and drunkenness, lewdness
and extravagance, by interrupting the hand of the diligent
and industrious; and, instead of promoting true religion,
sincere and unaffected piety, by recommending severe austerities,
scrupulous niceties, and erroneous notions, to drive
some to despair, and to deter others from embracing the
religion of our blessed Saviour."</p>

<p>After quoting from Whitefield's autobiography, the writer
proceeds to say, "What a mixture is here of enthusiasm and
presumptuous self-arrogance! What strange doctrine does
this babbler teach! What an encouragement does he give
to Deists to persevere in their infidelity, and to reject that
gospel of Christ, which this wonderfully illuminated, this
<em>would-be-thought</em> divinely inspired teacher, pretends to
recommend! His arrogancy and monstrous presumption
appear in aspersing the memory of our immortal Tillotson;
but Tillotson's name will be venerable to all, for piety, good
sense, and learning, and will remain so to the latest posterity,
when this <em>upstart</em> will be buried in oblivion, or will be only
remembered as a vain and arrogant person." The author
concludes with choice aspersions like the following:&mdash;"Pragmatical
teacher;" "puerile declaimer, intoxicated with
spiritual pride;" "ostentatious and vain-glorious;" and "so
full of his own sagacity as to be past conviction."</p>

<p>Whitefield's letter against Archbishop Tillotson was only
one of his imprudent productions. His "Letter to a Friend
in London, shewing the fundamental Error of a Book,
entitled 'The Whole Duty of Man,'" occasioned the publication
of the following:&mdash;"A modest and serious Defence of
the Author of 'The Whole Duty of Man,' from the False
Charges and gross Misrepresentations of Mr. Whitefield and
the Methodists his Adherents. By a Presbyter of the Church
of England. London, 1740." (8vo. 44 pp.)</p>

<p>Want of space renders it impossible to enter into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
theological discussion. Suffice it to say, that "Presbyter"
writes with great ability; but occasionally there is a passage
which is uncharitable and unjust. The following is the concluding
paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Our Saviour tells us, that every tree is known by its fruit; and what
are the fruits of the Spirit? Not vain and confident boasting; not rash,
uncharitable censures, damning all that do not feel what they feel; not
gathering tumultuous assemblies, to the disturbance of the public peace,
or the prejudice of families; not denying man the use of God's creatures,
which He hath appointed to be received with thanksgiving; not setting at
nought all rule and authority, nor intruding into other men's labours; not
encouraging abstinence, prayer, or any other religious exercises, to the
neglect of the duties of our station. Not these, nor any such disorderly
doings, however coloured with a specious show of piety, are the fruits of
the Spirit; but love, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, meekness.
God is not the author of confusion, but of peace and of a sound
mind; and, whenever you observe contrary effects in those who pretend
to more than common gifts, you may be very certain, that, whatever
spirit else they are led by, they are not led by the Spirit of God."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield's Letters against Tillotson and "The Whole
Duty of Man" called forth another pamphlet, of sixteen
pages, entitled, "A curious Letter, from a Gentleman to Mr.
Whitefield, wherein he proves that Mr. Whitefield knows
much less of Christianity than either Archbishop Tillotson
or the Author of 'The Whole Duty of Man:' With Remarks
by Aquila Smyth, Layman of the Church of England."</p>

<p>Mr. Smyth is too abusive to be respected. He says
Whitefield had written and published his two letters, "in the
gall of bitterness, in the spirit of pride, malice, and envy;
and had depreciated the most valuable works of other men
on purpose to aggrandise himself, and gain credit and
reputation to his own weak, nay, impudent, nay, wicked performances."</p>

<p>The following is the last sentence of Mr. Smyth's pamphlet:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Who but a set of mad and frantic minds, would ever have deserted a
Church, where all the necessaries to salvation are so constantly preached
and practised, for the sake of following some fiery zealots, who have withdrawn
themselves from the communion of the Church of England, more
for want of her preferments, than her want of the principles and practices
of Christianity?"</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the most virulent pamphlets, published against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
Whitefield in 1740, bore the following title: "The true
Spirit of the Methodists, and their Allies fully laid open."
(8vo. 98 pp.) The pamphlet is an over-heated defence of
Dr. Trapp, but the writer also takes the opportunity of
abusing the Methodists in general, and Whitefield in particular.
A <em>few</em> of the sentences and passages in which
Whitefield is personally attacked are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In a confused huddle of stuff, he (Whitefield) abuses Dr. Trapp."
"What he says about the beast with seven heads coming out of the sea,
and Solomon's seven abominations in the heart, is perfect <em>Quakerism</em>,
enthusiastic madness and malice." "This is some of Whitefield's nonsensical
and malicious jargon." "What can one say more to this notorious
slanderer, and liar, who says just what he pleases to abuse the clergy
with all the malice of hell, without alleging the least appearance of one
single proof?" "Whitefield's cant and nonsense again!" "He concludes
with his ungodly jumble of <em>railing</em> and <em>praying</em>." "He is both impious
and ignorant; and his labours tend not to the salvation, but to the damnation
of souls." "All the world knows the pride, impudence, and insolence
of Whitefield." "Whitefield has, within these three years, gathered
more money than one of the generality of the clergy receives, from his
preferment, in twenty."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another publication must be noticed, "The Trial of Mr.
Whitefield's Spirit. In some Remarks upon his Fourth
Journal. London, 1740." (8vo. 55 pp.) This is a cleverly
written pamphlet; and, from the author's standpoint, not
particularly unfair. No doubt, it is scathing; but that,
perhaps, arises from the faultiness of Whitefield's published
Journals. The writer declares, that, he has never seen
Whitefield, and has no ill-will towards him. Indeed, he had
been "rather prejudiced in his favour; and, at his first
appearance, he had thought, his diligence in his ministry was
truly commendable." By reading his Journals, however, his
now anonymous censor had become "convinced that he was
actuated by a high degree of enthusiasm, which had prompted
him to say many things inconsiderate, uncharitable, and even
blasphemous."</p>

<p>A few extracts from this able pamphlet must suffice.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Whitefield is more positive, more contemptuous, and fierce in his
expressions [in his fourth Journal] than heretofore: More assuming and
bold in applying to himself what can never belong to any one but the Son
of God: And his censures of persons, <em>civil</em> and <em>sacred</em>, who do not <em>confess</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
<em>and own him</em>, as he daringly expresses it, are opprobrious and unchristian
in a higher degree than in the former Journals."</p>

<p>"Such affected expressions as these sufficiently mark out the disposition
of this man's heart&mdash;a solicitude about what the crowd thinks or says
of his preaching, a self-satisfaction and complacence in his own performances,
with an impotence of mind unable to conceal its pleasure, when at
any time it fancies it has performed beyond the common degree of its
abilities."</p>

<p>"The conduct of this gentleman, in publishing the daily occurrences of
his life, is without example, and unjustified by any precedent among the
saints of God. As the Holy Spirit Himself, in recording even the life of
the blessed Jesus, has comprised it in a very short and compendious
narrative, and observed a surprising modesty and reserve (if we may so
express it) in giving us the account of His deeds and doctrines; it must
infallibly follow that Mr. Whitefield's pompous history of his ministry, and
of the smallest circumstances relating to his affairs, can never proceed
from the same Spirit, which has recorded with so sparing a hand the
memorials of the Author and Finisher of our salvation."</p>

<p>"The Holy Spirit has nowhere in Scripture been pleased to be so particular
as these modern casuists in marking out precisely what exercise,
amusement, or diversion is criminal. It is only Mr. Whitefield and his
brotherhood, who denounce damnation to men on their appearing at a
horse-race, a ball, or an assembly; whither persons, who live in a habit
of virtue, and keep their passions under due subjection, may no doubt as
safely go, as to any other places of public resort. And even these gentlemen
may possibly be conscious to themselves, that <em>their</em> unrestrained
resort to their <em>women-societies</em> may subject them to the same sorts of
hazards and trials, that are supposed to beset people at balls and assemblies."</p></blockquote>

<p>In addition to these publications, another must be noticed,
the vilest of the vile, and, in many places, so polluted, that it
would be a crime to quote it, "The Expounder Expounded;
or, Annotations upon that incomparable piece, entitled, A
Short Account of God's Dealings with the Rev. Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;e
W&mdash;&mdash;f&mdash;&mdash;d. By R&mdash;&mdash;ph J&mdash;&mdash;ps&mdash;&mdash;n, of the Inner Temple,
Esq. London, 1740." (8vo. 85 pp.) For the sake of decency,
the mere mentioning of this filthy, obscenely jocular,
and blasphemous publication must suffice.</p>

<p>To all these must be added the <cite>Weekly Miscellany</cite>, which
continued to entertain its readers with leading articles,
denouncing Whitefield, and full of Mr. Hooker's characteristic
banter.</p>

<p>To be pelted with such paper pellets was far from pleasant;
but it was inevitable. No man can attain to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
Whitefield's notoriety without being criticised, by both
friends and foes. It is a tax which man must pay for being
popular. Besides, it cannot be denied, that, <em>some</em> of Whitefield's
castigations were not altogether unmerited.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this abuse, however, an encomium was
published, which, as an extremely rare curiosity, may fitly close
the present chapter. This was a curious, but not ill-executed
engraving, with the title, "The Parallel Reformers; or, the
Renowned Wickliff and the Reverend Mr. Whitefield compared;
shewing, by many parallel instances, the great resemblance
between the pious Divines in respect of Christian
zeal and fortitude. Improved from some curious observations
lately published at Boston, in New England, and reprinted
at London: Whereunto are added their Effigies curiously
engraved."</p>

<p>Nothing need be said respecting the "effigies," except that,
under Whitefield's, there is the following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Champion of God, thy Lord proclaim,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Jesus alone resolve to know;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Tread down thy foes in Jesu's name:<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Go&mdash;conqu'ring and to conquer go.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"<span class="smcap">Charles Wesley.</span>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Lewis's outline of Wickliff's history need not be given;
but the following (especially Mr. Nixon's prophecy) is too
curious to be omitted:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There has scarce anything appeared, says our New England author,
in these last ages of the Church, more remarkable than the conduct and
character of this wonderful young minister, Mr. Whitefield. Were he to
escape persecution, he would want one evidence of his Divine mission,
one badge of a disciple of Christ. Our author leaves it to others to determine
whether what Mr. Fox says of Wickliff can with equal justice be
said of Mr. Whitefield, namely, 'That even as the morning star in the
midst of a cloud, and as the moon at the full, and as the bright beams of
the sun, so doth this man shine and glitter in the temple and church of
God.' But this he is sure of, that there is a vast resemblance between the
men. For, both were born in the same country; both educated in the
same university; both ministers in the same Church of England; both
champions for the same faith, even that faith that was at first delivered to
the saints. Wickliff and his followers, (as Bishop Burnet affirms,) in those
early days, like Mr. Whitefield and his followers in our own time, preached
not only in churches, but also in the open fields, churchyards, and
markets, without license from the Ordinary, etc.; the one a glorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
reformer of the Church from Popery, the other an illustrious restorer of
the doctrines of the Reformation; the one labouring to reduce the Church
to that purity which she attained 200 years after him, the other endeavouring
to revive those truths which she universally embraced almost 200
years before him: both men of like zeal, both treated in the same manner.
Mr. Whitefield preaches against, and laments the degeneracy of, our
modern divines, with respect to the doctrines of original sin, free-will,
justification of man, of good works, of the new birth or regeneration, of
works before justification, of predestination, and election, etc. He militates
against moral preachers and their doctrines, as well as against the
immorality of men's lives. Mr. Wickliff, on the other hand, opposed the
absurd doctrines, visions, lives, and insolent behaviour of the clergy. He,
like his great Master, inculcated the morality of the gospel, and the study
of the Holy Scriptures, instead of preaching for doctrines the commandments
of men. Some of his peculiar doctrines are said to be these; viz.,
He not only denied the Pope's supremacy, but was against any persons
assuming the title and authority of being the <em>Head of the Church</em>, asserting
that it is blasphemy to call any one <em>Head of the Church</em> save Christ alone.
He condemned Episcopacy, as being a creature of princes' setting up;
for he asserted that, in the time of the apostles, there were only two orders,
viz., priests and deacons, and that a bishop doth not differ from a priest.
He was for having ministers maintained by the voluntary contributions of
the people, and not by tythes settled on them by law, saying that tythes
are pure alms, and that pastors are not to exact them by ecclesiastical
censures. He was not for giving the Church a <em>power to decree Rites and
Ceremonies</em>, and to <em>determine Controversies of Faith</em>. For, it is said, that,
he slighted the authority of General Councils, and affirmed that wise men
leave that as impertinent, which is not plainly expressed in Scripture. He
was also against prescribed Forms of Prayer, but especially against imposing
of them. Nay, further, it is affirmed to be a doctrine of Mr.
Wickliff, that baptism doth not confer, but only signify, grace, which was
given before. And he calls those fools and presumptuous, who affirm
such infants cannot be saved who die without baptism.</p>

<p>"There are not a few who think the following prophecy of <em>Nixon</em> (being
as yet, it is supposed, unfulfilled) has a respect to the Rev. Mr. <em>Whitefield</em>
and his followers, and that it will have its accomplishment in the Christian
people called Methodists:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>A young new set of men, of virtuous manners, shall come, who shall
prosper, and make a flourishing Church for two hundred years.</em>"</p></blockquote>

<p>Among the countless Methodist broad-sheets, issued in the
days of Whitefield and the Wesleys, there are none more
curious than this of J. Lewis, of Bartholomew Close, London.</p>

<h2><em>WHITEFIELD'S RETURN TO ENGLAND IN 1741.</em></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">March to July, 1741.</span></h3>


<p>Whitefield embarked at Charleston on the 16th
of January, 1741, and landed at Falmouth on
March 11. His time on board was principally occupied
in composing sermons, and in writing letters, chiefly to the
friends whom he had left behind him. A few extracts will
be useful.</p>

<p>To the Rev. Mr. Cooper, at Boston, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Last Saturday" (January 10) "I was taken up, for being concerned in
correcting the enclosed printed letter, written by Mr. Hugh Bryan.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> I am
bound over to appear next sessions, as well as Mr. Bryan: he, I believe,
for libelling the king, and I for libelling the clergy, in saying they break
the canons daily. These are earnests of what I must expect to meet in
my native country; but our Lord will be our refuge in every storm. I
expect my family will be like the burning bush. I find, I am in debt for
them upwards of £600; but the Lord will provide. I wish to sink
exceeding low, and cry out, 'Grace! grace! O the love of God! the
sovereignty of Christ! the unchangeable loving-kindness of our heavenly
Father!' Excuse me, dear Mr. Cooper; my heart is full. I want all men
to love the Lord Jesus. It greatly rejoices me, to hear so many are coming
to Him. I cannot but think that He will let His Word run, and be
abundantly glorified in America. Boston people are much upon my
heart. The memory of their forefathers is precious to me. May you live
to see the spirit of scriptural <em>Puritanism</em> universally prevail! I hope you
will write every opportunity. If I am in prison, to hear that Boston
people are alive to Christ will make me arise at midnight to sing praises
to God."</p></blockquote>

<p>To another friend, he wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<em>February 8, 1741.</em>
</p>

<p>"I expect to suffer great things. The Lord, however, is able to deliver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
me out of all. I have just now had His Divine assistance in composing a
sermon. This is the sixth which I have finished since I have been on
board. O my dear brother, love a precious Christ, and shew it by adorning
His gospel in all things. He has highly favoured you. If you and I
think anything too much to be done for Him, we are of all men the most
ungrateful. O the love of Christ! I feel it&mdash;I feel it. Write to me. If
in prison, my friends will bring the letter to me there. God will hear me
for you, even in a dungeon."</p></blockquote>

<p>To a minister at Charleston, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<em>February 17, 1741.</em>
</p>

<p>"I have been enabled to prepare nine discourses for the press. My
body waxes stronger; and, last night, the great God, in a glorious manner,
filled and overshadowed my soul. I am panting for the complete holiness
of Jesus my Lord. At the receipt of this, turn your prayers into praises,
and then turn your praises into prayers, in behalf of your affectionate
brother,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The following was addressed to Mr. Jonathan Barber,
whom he had left at Bethesda, to officiate as a sort of
chaplain, during his absence:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<em>February 17, 1741.</em>
</p>

<p>"We have hitherto had scarce any contrary winds, and are now near
the Western Isles. We had one storm the first week, but almost ever since
have been favoured with weather, as well as wind. O that you would call
the family together, and praise the Lord for the mercies conferred on us,
the unworthiest of the sons of men! I long to hear what the Lord has
done for your souls. Do you live in love? Do you strive together with
me in your prayers? Does Bethesda answer its name? Is it, indeed,
a house of mercy? I hope to have these questions answered in the
affirmative."</p></blockquote>

<p>Strangely enough, though Whitefield was in debt, and
was constantly speaking as though he was about to be sent
to prison, he was, at the same time, contemplating marriage.
Hence the following to a friend at Charleston:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<em>February 17, 1741.</em>
</p>

<p>"My soul is in a heavenly frame, swallowed up in God. It is almost
too big to speak. I will give it vent by writing to you. Our Master has
shewn me several tokens for good, which I desired of Him in secret prayer.
Last night, I think I received as full satisfaction as I could desire, in respect
to <em>my marriage</em>. I believe what I have done is of God; though I know
not when my heart was more disengaged from earthly thoughts than now.
I only desire that Jesus may be glorified in me, whether it be by life or by
death."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p>To Mr. James Habersham, Whitefield's overseer at Bethesda,
he wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<em>February 18, 1741.</em>
</p>

<p>"Yesterday we humbled ourselves<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> before God, and, by prayer and
fasting, sought for a blessing, and direction in all our affairs. I wish I had
kept family fasts at Savannah. Suppose you had one monthly at Bethesda?
I shall make all possible haste back, and remit money to you as often as
I can. I am persuaded, God will not let you want. I would not have
anything left undone, that is necessary for the family's comfortable subsistence.
The Lord is our shepherd; therefore, we shall not want. My
dear friend, let us study to be holy, even as Christ is holy. Let these be
your daily questions, 'Am I more like Christ? Am I more meek and
patient? Does my practice correspond with my knowledge? and am I a
light to enlighten and inflame all that are around me?'"</p></blockquote>

<p>The Rev. Ralph Erskine and his friends occupied a position
in Scotland, similar to that occupied by the Wesleys and
by Whitefield in England. Up to the present, Whitefield
and Erskine had never met; but they had exchanged letters.
Some of these have been already given. The following is
another:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">On board the 'Minerva</span>,' <em>February 16, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and very dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You and your brethren are
dearer to me than ever. Your 'Sonnets and Sermons' have been blessed
to me and many. The former are reprinted in America. I want all your
own and your brother's works. Since I have been on board, I have been
much helped by reading the 'Marrow of Modern Divinity.' I have just
perused 'Boston on the Covenant;' and, this morning, have been solacing
myself with your 'Paraphrase upon Solomon's Song.' Blessed be our
Lord, for helping you in that composition!</p>

<p>"Thanks be to rich and sovereign grace! I have experienced much of
the Spirit's influences in making nine sermons, which I intend to print by
subscription towards carrying on a Negro School, I am going to settle in
Pennsylvania. The price of them bound will be four shillings. If you or
your friends would take a few, it might be for the glory of God. My
Journal, which I bring over, will acquaint you how the work of God goes
on abroad.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Indeed, it is wonderful. The Orphan House has succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
far beyond expectation. I will send you the particulars as soon as I print
my 'Account.'</p>

<p>"I am now going to England, expecting to suffer great things. I hear,
there are sad divisions and errors sprung up among the brethren. In the
spirit of meekness I have answered dear Mr. Wesley's sermon, entitled
'Free Grace;' and trust God will enable me to bear a full and explicit
testimony to all His eternal truths.</p>

<p>"I believe it is my duty to marry. You will help me with your prayers
in this, as in all other respects. You see, dear sir, how freely I open my
heart to you, though I have never seen you face to face. If it be the will
of God, I shall be glad to come into your parts before I leave England;
but I fear my speedy return to America will not permit me. I purpose to
embark again in the latter end of July or the beginning of August.</p>

<p>"I hope my love will find acceptance with your dear brother, and all
the Associate Presbytery. My prayers always attend them. I should be
glad to sit at their feet, and be taught the way of God more perfectly.
Excuse this long letter. You are very dear to your unworthy friend,
brother, and servant in the blessed Jesus,</p>

"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Every chapter of Church history amply illustrates the
Divine utterance, "My thoughts are not your thoughts,
neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord." Whitefield
intended to re-embark for America in four months; but forty
months elapsed before he again set sail. Great events occurred
during this large section of his life; and, of these, not the
least important was his visit to Ralph and Ebenezer Erskine.
But more of this anon.</p>

<p>In the foregoing letter, Whitefield mentions his having
written an answer to Wesley's sermon on "Free Grace."
The two loving friends were now at variance. This painful
episode in the lives of Whitefield and Wesley must be briefly
noticed.</p>

<p>Soon after Whitefield embarked for America, in August,
1739, Wesley published the following:&mdash;"Free Grace: a
Sermon preached at Bristol. By John Wesley, M.A., Fellow
of Lincoln College, Oxford. Bristol: printed by S. and F.
Farley, 1739." (pp. 35.) "Wesley's sermon on 'Free Grace,'"
says the late Rev. Thomas Jackson, "is the most powerful
and impassioned of all his compositions." The Calvinistic
doctrine of election, involving, as Wesley contends, the
doctrine of reprobation, is condemned in the strongest terms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
Wesley, with his accustomed conciseness, puts the matter
thus: "Call it by whatever name you please, 'election,
preterition, predestination, or reprobation,' it comes in the
end to the same thing. The sense of all is plainly this,&mdash;by
virtue of an eternal, unchangeable, irresistible decree of
God, one part of mankind are infallibly saved, and the rest
infallibly damned; it being impossible that any of the
former should be damned, or that any of the latter should
be saved." Wesley states his objections to such a doctrine;
and, it is not too much to say, that his objections are unanswerable.
His publication of this famous sermon was not
an act of wantonness. In a brief address to the reader, he
says, "Nothing but the strongest conviction, not only of
what is here advanced as 'the truth as it is in Jesus,' but
also that I am indispensably obliged to declare this truth to
all the world, could have induced me openly to oppose the
sentiments of those whom I esteem for their works' sake;
at whose feet, may I be found in the day of the Lord
Jesus!"</p>

<p>This was written and published in 1739. Dr. Whitehead
says, Wesley sent a copy of his sermon "to Commissary
Garden, at Charleston, where Mr. Whitefield met
with it; and though the subject of predestination was
treated in that sermon, in a general way, without naming or
pointing at any individual, yet Mr. Whitefield found himself
hurt, that Mr. Wesley should publicly oppose an opinion
which he believed to be agreeable to the word of God."<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>This, however, was not the only thing which gave offence.
In 1740, appeared the following: "Hymns and Sacred
Poems. Published by John Wesley, M.A., Fellow of Lincoln
College, Oxford, and Charles Wesley, M.A., Student of
Christ Church, Oxford. London: printed by W. Strahan;
and sold by James Hutton, 1740." (12mo, 207 pp.) To
these "Hymns and Sacred Poems," Wesley prefixed a
preface of eleven pages, in which he taught and enforced
his doctrine of Christian perfection. That doctrine he never
set higher than in this memorable preface; indeed, in after
life, he wished to modify some of its strong assertions. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
reader has already seen, in the extracts from letters already
given, that, Whitefield was as strongly opposed to the views
of Wesley on this subject, as he was to Wesley's opinions
on predestination. But more than this: Wesley's "Hymns
and Sacred Poems" contained certain hymns on "Universal
Redemption," one of which, consisting of thirty-six stanzas,
had been affixed to Wesley's sermon on "Free Grace."
The hymn was written by Charles Wesley, and includes the
following verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<em>For every man He tasted death,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i3"><em>He suffer'd once for all</em>;<br /></span>

<span class="i3">And all <em>may</em> hear the call.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i1">When God invites, shall man repel?<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Shall man the exception make?<br /></span>

<span class="i3">Against the dire decree!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Charles Wesley's strongly worded verses offended Whitefield.
They exhibited his favourite doctrine in a repulsive
light. Hence, on December 24, 1740, he wrote, at Bethesda,
his "Answer to Wesley's Sermon on Free Grace,"&mdash;an
answer which will be noticed shortly. Meanwhile, on his
passage to England, he addressed the following to Charles
Wesley and his brother conjointly:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<em>February 1, 1741.</em>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear, dear Brethren</span>,&mdash;Why did you throw out the bone of contention?
Why did you print that sermon against predestination? Why did
you, in particular, my dear brother Charles, affix your hymn, and join in
putting out your late hymn-book? How can you say, you will not dispute
with me about election, and yet print such hymns, and your brother send
his sermon, against election, to Mr. Garden, and others in America? Do
not you think, my dear brethren, I must be as much concerned for truth,
or what I think truth, as you? God is my judge, I always was, and hope
I always shall be, desirous that you may be preferred before me. But I
must preach the gospel of Christ, and that I cannot <em>now</em> do, without
speaking of election. My answer to the sermon is now being printed at
Charleston; another copy I have sent to Boston; and another I now
bring with me, to print in London. If it occasion a strangeness between
us, it shall not be my fault. There is nothing in my answer exciting to it,
that I know of. O my dear brethren, my heart almost bleeds within me!
Methinks, I could be willing to tarry here on the waters for ever, rather
than come to England to oppose you."<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>All this occurred previous to Whitefield's landing at
Falmouth, on the 11th of March, 1741. A year and a
half ago, Whitefield had left England with a popularity
unequalled. He returned under circumstances which, to a
temperament like his, must have been exceedingly distressing.
His important friend, William Seward, was dead.
James Hutton, who had hitherto been his publisher, had
refused to act in this capacity any longer, because Whitefield
had embraced the Calvinian creed.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> For the same reason,
an estrangement between Whitefield and his most tenderly
beloved friends, John and Charles Wesley, seemed to be
inevitable. He had contracted large debts, and had nought
to pay them. By his injudicious censures pronounced
against Tillotson and the author of "The Whole Duty of
Man," thousands of his former admirers had been prejudiced
against him. Many of his quondam friends were now his
foes; but a few remained faithful, and had already commenced
to build him a "tabernacle," closely adjoining Wesley's
Foundery, in the neighbourhood of Moorfields. A fortnight
after he landed in England, he wrote the following letter to
James Habersham, at Bethesda:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>March 25, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;We arrived at Falmouth last Wednesday seven-night,
and got here the Sunday following. Blessed be God! we had a
summer's passage.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>"I find, many of our friends are sadly divided, and, as far as I am able
to judge, have been sadly misled. Congregations, at Moorfields, and
Kennington Common, on Sunday, were as large as usual: on the following
weekdays, quite contrary; twenty thousand dwindled down to two or
three hundred.</p>

<p>"It has been a trying time with me. I have a large orphan family,
consisting of near a hundred persons, to be maintained, about four
thousand miles off, without the least fund, and in the dearest part of his
Majesty's dominions. I am, also, above £1000 in debt for them, and am
not worth £20 in the world of my own. I am threatened to be arrested
for £350, drawn for, in favour of the Orphan House, by my late dear
deceased friend and fellow-traveller, Mr. Seward. My bookseller, who,
I believe, has gotten some <em>hundreds</em> by me, being drawn away by the
Moravians, refuses to print for me. Many, very many of my spiritual
children, who, at my last departure from England, would have plucked
out their own eyes to have given me, are so prejudiced, by the dear
Messrs. Wesleys' dressing up the doctrine of election in such horrible
colours, that they will neither hear, see, nor give me the least assistance:
yea, some of them send threatening letters, that God will speedily destroy
me. As for the people of the world, they are so embittered by my
<em>injudicious and too severe expressions</em> against Archbishop Tillotson, and
the author of the 'Whole Duty of Man,' that they flee from me as from a
viper. And, what is most cutting of all, I am now constrained, on account
of our differing in principles, publicly to separate from my dear, dear
old friends, Messrs. John and Charles Wesley, whom I still love as my
own soul.</p>

<p>"Through infinite mercy, however, I am enabled to strengthen myself
in the Lord my God. I am cast down, but not destroyed; perplexed, but
not in despair. A few days ago, in reading Beza's 'Life of Calvin,' these
words were much impressed upon me, 'Calvin is turned out of Geneva,
but, behold a new church arises!' Jesus, the ever-loving, altogether
lovely Jesus, pities and comforts me.</p>

<p>"My friends are erecting a place, which I have called a <em>Tabernacle</em>, for
morning's exposition. I have not made, nor can I, as yet, make any collections;
but let us not fear. Our heavenly Father, with whom the fatherless
find mercy, will provide. Let us only seek first the kingdom of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
and His righteousness, and all other necessary things shall be added
unto us.</p>

<p>"In about a fortnight, though I scarce know an oak from a hickory, or
one kind of land from another, I am subpoenaed to appear before Parliament,
to give an account of the province of Georgia, when I left it. This,
I suppose, is occasioned by the party, which has been so inveterate
against the honourable the trustees, whom they accuse of misemploying
the public moneys. The event, which undoubtedly will be in favour of
the trustees, you may know hereafter. In the meantime, believe me to
be yours most affectionately,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Trouble awaited Whitefield, not only in London but at
Kingswood. In 1739, he commenced a school for the
colliers in Kingswood, and left Wesley to finish it. In the
spring of 1740, Wesley opened it, and appointed John
Cennick to be its master. Soon after his appointment,
Cennick turned Calvinist, and imbued some of the members
of Kingswood Society with his principles. "Alas!" wrote
Charles Wesley, on November 30, 1740, "we have set the
wolf to keep the sheep. For many months, John Cennick
has been undermining our doctrine and authority." Cennick,
and those who entertained his views, formed themselves into
a separate society, and held meetings apart from their
brethren. He also wrote to Whitefield in America, urging
him to return without delay, to assist him in the doctrinal
warfare he was waging among the poor colliers. A few
days before Whitefield landed at Falmouth, the Kingswood
controversy reached its crisis. After various warnings and
expostulations, Wesley, on March 6th, called on the people
to make their choice between him and Cennick. Fifty-two
seceded with Cennick, and upwards of ninety remained with
Wesley. From this time, to use Wesley's words, "there,
were two sorts of Methodists; those for particular, and those
for general, redemption."<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>As soon as Whitefield arrived in London, Cennick informed
him of what had taken place; and, in reply, Whitefield
wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>March 25, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My very dear Brother</span>,&mdash;Hasten hither with all speed; and then
we shall see what God intends to do for us and by us. It is a trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
time now in the church. The Lord give us a due mixture of the lamb
and lion! Some, who have been led astray, begin to recover. The Lord
make way for His own truths! My love to the colliers, and all friends.
Many, I suppose, will be shy. I am become a monster even to several
who were wrought upon by my ministry; but it must needs be that offences
should come. Adieu! Excuse brevity. Hasten, and speak face to face
with yours most affectionately in Christ Jesus,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Amid all this Methodist confusion, Whitefield arrived in
England. One of his first acts after his coming was to publish
his answer to Wesley's Sermon on "Free Grace." The
title was, "A Letter to the Rev. Mr. John Wesley, in Answer
to his Sermon, entitled 'Free Grace.' By George Whitefield,
A.B., late of Pembroke College, Oxford. London: printed
by W. Straham, for T. Cooper." (8vo. 31 pp.) Affixed to
it were the Articles of the Church of England, on "Original
or Birth Sin," "Free Will," and "Predestination and Election;"
and also a hymn, by the great Dissenter, Dr. Watts,
containing the following verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Behold the potter and the clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He forms his vessels as he please;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">And yet be just and gracious still?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i1">Can crush a thousand worlds to dust?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Of set purpose, the theological arguments of both Wesley
and Whitefield are here omitted. The reader must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
satisfied with those parts of Whitefield's letter that are
purely personal.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Bethesda, in Georgia</span>, <em>December 24, 1740</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and very dear Brother</span>,&mdash;God only knows what
unspeakable sorrow of heart I have felt on your account, since I left
England last. Whether it be my infirmity or not, I frankly confess, that,
Jonah could not have gone with more reluctance to Nineveh, than I now
take pen in hand to write against you. Were nature to speak, I had
rather die than do it; and yet, if I am faithful to God, I must not stand
neuter any longer. I am very apprehensive that our common adversaries
will rejoice to see us differing among ourselves. But what can I say?
The children of God are in danger of falling into error. Nay, numbers
have been misled, whom God has been pleased to work upon by my
ministry; and a greater number are still calling aloud upon me, to shew
also my opinion. I must then shew, that I know no man after the flesh,
and that I have no respect of persons, any further than is consistent with
my duty to my Lord and Master, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"This letter, no doubt, will lose me many friends. Perhaps God has
laid this difficult task upon me, to see whether I am willing to forsake all
for Him, or not. From such considerations as these, I think it my duty
to bear an humble testimony, and to plead earnestly for the truths which,
I am convinced, are clearly revealed in the word of God; in the defence
whereof, I must use great plainness of speech, and treat my dearest
friends upon earth with the greatest simplicity, faithfulness, and freedom,
leaving the consequences of all to God.</p>

<p>"For some time before, and especially since, my last departure from
England, both in public and private, by preaching and printing, you have
been propagating the doctrine of <em>universal redemption</em>. And, when I
remember how Paul reproved Peter for his dissimulation, I fear I have
been sinfully silent too long. O then be not angry with me, dear and
honoured sir, if now I deliver my soul, by telling you, that I think, in this,
you greatly err.</p>

<p>"Before I enter upon the discourse, entitled 'Free Grace,' give me
leave to notice what, in your preface, you term an indispensable obligation
to make it public to all the world. I must own, that, I always thought
you were quite mistaken upon that head. The case, you know, stands
thus: When you were at Bristol, I think, you received a letter from a
private hand, charging you with not preaching the gospel, because you
did not preach election. Upon this, you drew a lot: the answer was,
'preach and print.' I have often questioned, as I do now, whether, in so
doing, you did not tempt the Lord. A due exercise of religious prudence,
without a lot, would have directed you in that matter. Besides, I never
heard that you enquired of God, whether or not election was a gospel
doctrine. But, I fear, taking it for granted, it was not, you only enquired,
whether you should be silent, or preach and print against it?<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> However<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
this be, the lot came out, '<em>preach and print</em>;' accordingly, you preached
and printed against election. At my desire, you suppressed the publishing
of the sermon whilst I was in England; but soon sent it into the world
after my departure. O that you had kept it in! However, if that sermon
was printed in answer to a lot, I am apt to think, one reason why God
should so suffer you to be deceived was, that, hereby a special obligation
might be laid upon me faithfully to declare the Scripture doctrine of
election.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I frankly acknowledge, I believe the doctrine of reprobation, in this
view, that God intends to give His saving grace, through Jesus Christ,
only to a certain number, and that the rest of mankind, after the fall of
Adam, being justly left of God to continue in sin, will at last suffer that
eternal death, which is its proper wages.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I would not judge of the truth of election, by the experience of any
particular persons. If I did, (O bear with me in this foolishness of
boasting!) I think I might glory in election. For these five or six years,
I have received the witness of God's Spirit. Since that, I have not
doubted a quarter of an hour of a saving interest in Jesus Christ. And,
if I must speak freely, I believe your fighting so strenuously against the
doctrine of election, and pleading so vehemently for a sinless perfection,
are among the reasons or culpable causes, why you are kept out of the
liberties of the gospel, and from that full assurance of faith, which they
enjoy, who have experimentally tasted, and daily feed upon, God's electing,
everlasting love."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Dear, dear sir, O be not offended! For Christ's sake, be not rash!
Give yourself to reading. Study the covenant of grace. Down with your
carnal reasoning! Be a little child; and, then, instead of pawning your
salvation, as you have done in a late hymn-book, if the doctrine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
<em>universal redemption</em> be not true; instead of talking of <em>sinless perfection</em>,
as you have done in the preface to that hymn-book; and instead of
making man's salvation to depend on his own <em>free will</em>, as you have in
this sermon, you will compose a hymn in praise of sovereign distinguishing
love. You will caution believers against striving to work a perfection
out of their own hearts, and print another sermon the reverse of this, and
entitle it, 'Free Grace <em>Indeed</em>.' Free, because not free to all; but free,
because God may withhold or give it to whom and when He pleases.</p>

<p>"Dear sir, as I told you before, so I declare again, nothing but a single
regard to the honour of Christ has forced this letter from me. I love and
honour you for His sake; and, when I come to judgment, will thank
you, before men and angels, for what you have, under God, done for my
soul."</p></blockquote>

<p>The spirit breathing in this letter is beautiful. The
opinions of Whitefield and Wesley were wide apart; but
their heartfelt affection for each other was undiminished.
Had they been left to themselves, they would lovingly have
agreed to differ. John Cennick, a good man, and brave
evangelist, was violently prejudiced against the Wesleys, and
had more influence with Whitefield than was profitable.
Noble-hearted Howell Harris, also, felt so strongly respecting
the disagreement, that, in a letter dated October 27, 1740,
his godly wrath branded Wesley's opposition of the Calvinian
doctrines with the offensive epithet, "hellish infection."
Joseph Humphreys, whom Wesley had employed to preach
in the Foundery, London, renounced his connection with
Methodism's founder, embraced Whitefield's tenets, and
became an ardent and active partisan. J. Lewis started the
first Methodist newspaper ever published, and succeeded in
securing Whitefield, Cennick, Harris, and Humphreys as its
principal contributors.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> Under such circumstances, division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
became almost inevitable. Whitefield's letters plainly shew
that this was a disaster which he devoutly dreaded; and
Wesley, nearly forty years afterwards, declared that he and
his brother endeavoured to prevent it. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Who made the division? It was not I. It was not my brother. It
was Mr. Whitefield himself; and that notwithstanding all admonitions,
arguments, and entreaties. Mr. Whitefield first wrote a treatise against
me by name. He sent it to my brother, who endorsed it with these words,
'Put up again thy sword into its place.' It slept a while; but, after a time,
he published it. I made no reply. Soon after, Mr. Whitefield preached
against my brother and me by name. This he did constantly, both in
Moorfields, and in all other public places. We never returned railing for
railing, but spoke honourably of him, at all times, and in all places. But
is it any wonder, that those who loved us should no longer choose to hear
him? Meantime, was it we that turned their hearts against him? Was
it not <em>himself</em>?' It was not merely the difference of doctrine that caused
the division. It was rather Mr. Whitefield's <em>manner</em> wherein he maintained
his doctrine, and treated us in every place. Otherwise difference
of doctrine would not have created any difference of affection; but he
might lovingly have held particular redemption, and we general, to our
lives' end. Even when he preached in the very Foundery, and my brother
sat by him, he preached the absolute decrees in the most peremptory and
offensive manner.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> What was this, but drawing the sword, and throwing
away the scabbard? Who then is chargeable with the contention and
division that ensued?"<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This seems to bear somewhat hardly against Whitefield;
but there is no means of disproving it. Whitefield, naturally
impetuous, had impulsive advisers; and, no doubt, with
the best intentions, said things which probably he himself
afterwards regretted. No zeal is more rabid than that
engendered by theological disputes; and, very often, the
fierceness of the zeal is increased by the godly earnestness of
the disputers.</p>

<p>In one respect, Wesley had thrown down the gage; that
is, he had published a sermon against predestination, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
which Whitefield now believed; but he had not mentioned
Whitefield's name, nor had he used a single expression that
could be thought to allude to him. He had, also, six weeks
before Whitefield's arrival in London, done another thing
which partisans might perhaps interpret maliciously. By
some means, a private letter, which Whitefield had written
to Wesley (and which is referred to, p. 414), had been
printed;<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> no doubt, because it condemned Wesley's doctrine
of perfection, and the publication of his sermon on "Free
Grace." This letter, dated "Boston, September 25, 1740,"
was printed without either Whitefield's or Wesley's leave;
and a great number of copies were distributed in the Foundery,
and at its door. Of course, Wesley, at once, perceived
the meanness and malice of this proceeding; and wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1741. February 1, Sunday. Having procured one of the copies, I
related, after preaching, the naked fact to the congregation, and told them,
'I will do just what I believe Mr. Whitefield would, were he here himself.'
Upon which I tore it in pieces before them all. Every one who had received
it, did the same. So that, in two minutes, there was not a whole
copy left. Ah! poor Ahithophel!"</p></blockquote>

<p>It is highly probable that Whitefield's friends and admirers
would resent this public tearing up of one of his epistles;
but, remembering the surreptitious character of the whole proceeding,
and also the malevolence of the object to be accomplished,
every right-minded man will at once acknowledge,
that, apart from the thing being done in a place of public
worship, there was nothing in Wesley's act to be condemned.</p>

<p>How did the matter end? The following are extracts
from Wesley's Journal:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1741. March 28, Saturday. Having heard much of Mr. Whitefield's
unkind behaviour, since his return from Georgia, I went to him to hear
him speak for himself, that I might know how to judge. I much approved
of his plainness of speech. He told me, he and I preached two different
gospels; and, therefore, he not only would not join with me, or give me the
right hand of fellowship, but was resolved publicly to preach against me
and my brother, wheresoever he preached at all. Mr. Hall (who went
with me) put him in mind of the promise he had made but a few days
before, that, whatever his private opinion was, he would never publicly
preach against us. He said, that promise was only an effect of human
weakness, and he was now of another mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<p>"April 4, Saturday. I believed both love and justice required that I
should speak my sentiments freely to Mr. Whitefield, concerning the letter
he had published, said to be in answer to my sermon on 'Free Grace.'
The sum of what I observed to him was this: 1. That, it was quite imprudent
to publish it at all, as being only the putting of weapons into their
hands, who loved neither the one nor the other. 2. That, if he was constrained
to bear his testimony (as he termed it) against the error I was in,
he might have done it by publishing a treatise on this head, without ever
calling my name in question. 3. That, what he had published was a mere
burlesque upon an answer, leaving four of my eight arguments untouched,
and handling the other four in so gentle a manner, as if he were afraid
they would burn his fingers. However, that, 4. He had said enough of
what was wholly foreign to the question, to make an open (and, probably,
irreparable) breach between him and me; seeing 'for a treacherous wound,
and for the betraying of secrets, every friend will depart.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>The last sentence, of course, refers to Whitefield's imprudent
and unfriendly revelation respecting Wesley casting lots
to ascertain whether he should "<em>preach and print</em>;" and it is
only fair to add, that this was the only part of Whitefield's
letter that was "wholly foreign to the question" in debate.</p>

<p>So much in reference to the difference respecting Calvinism.
There was, however, another bone of contention&mdash;Kingswood
School, and the school at Bristol. It seems
that Whitefield, somewhat petulantly, had complained of the
adornment of the chapel Wesley had built at Bristol, and of
the "lodgings" which had been provided in it for him and
for his brother. He had found fault, "that the children at
Bristol were clothed as well as taught;" and that "those at
Kingswood had been neglected." Wesley, in the month of
April, 1741, wrote a long letter in reply to these accusations.
He tells his old friend, that the only adornment in Bristol
chapel consisted of "a piece of green cloth nailed to the
desk; and two sconces, for eight candles each, in the
middle." In reference to the "lodgings," he says, "There is
a little room by the school where I speak to persons who
come to me; and a garret, in which a bed is placed for me.
And do you grudge me this? Is this the voice of my
brother, my son, Whitefield?" The accusation of the
children of Kingswood School being neglected is positively
denied. "One master and one mistress," writes Wesley,
"have been in the house ever since it was capable of receiving
them. A second master has been placed there some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
months since; and I have long been seeking for two proper
mistresses; so that as much has been done, if not more,
than I can answer to God and man." Wesley concludes his
letter thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You rank all the maintainers of universal redemption with Socinians.
Alas! my brother, do you not know that the Socinians allow no redemption
at all? that Socinus himself speaks thus: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tota redemptio nostra per
Christum metaphora?</i> and says expressly, 'Christ did not die as a ransom
for any, but only as an example for mankind'? How easy were it for me
to hit many other palpable blots in that which you call an 'Answer' to my
sermon! And how above measure contemptible would you then appear
to all impartial men, either of sense or learning! But I spare you; mine
hand shall not be upon you. The Lord be judge between me and thee!
The general tenor both of my public and private exhortations, when I
touch thereon at all, as even my enemies know, if they would testify, is,
'Spare the young man, even Absalom, for my sake.'"<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield and Wesley were separated; but, within
eighteen months after the publication of Whitefield's letter,
their old friendship was entirely re-established; and ever
afterwards, to the end of life, Wesley and Whitefield loved
each other with a love like that of David and Jonathan.
This will be amply shewn in succeeding pages. Meantime,
however, Whitefield was in great distress. He, afterwards,
wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I had written an answer" [to Wesley's sermon on Free Grace], "which,
though revised and much approved of by some good and judicious divines,
I think had some too strong expressions about absolute reprobation, which
the apostle leaves rather to be inferred than expressed. The world was
angry with me for writing my letters against the author of 'The Whole Duty
of Man' and Archbishop Tillotson; and numbers of my own spiritual
children were angry with me for writing my Answer to Mr. Wesley. Instead
of having thousands to attend me, scarce one of my spiritual children
came to see me from morning to night. Once, at Kennington Common,
I had not above a hundred to hear me. Never had I preached in Moorfields
on a week-day; but, in the strength of God, I began on Good
Friday. For some time, I continued to preach twice a day under one of
the trees, and had the mortification of seeing numbers of my spiritual
children, who but a twelvemonth ago would have plucked out their eyes
for me, running by me whilst preaching, disdaining so much as to look at
me; and some of them putting their fingers in their ears, that they might
not hear one word I said. Ten thousand times would I rather have died
than part with my old friends. It would have melted any heart to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
heard Mr. Charles Wesley and me weeping, after prayer, that, if possible,
the breach might be prevented. Once I preached in the Foundery, on
Gal. iii., but no more. All my work was to begin again. A like scene
opened at Bristol, where I was denied preaching in the house I had
founded. Busybodies, on both sides, blew up the coals. A breach ensued.
But, as both sides differed in judgment, and not in affection, and
aimed at the glory of our common Lord, (though on both sides we hearkened
too much to tale-bearers,) we were kept from anathematizing each
other, and went on in our usual way; being agreed in one point, endeavouring
to convert souls to the ever-blessed Mediator."<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, in England, Whitefield found trouble; from America
he derived joy. Towards the end of the month of March,
his two superintendents in the Georgia Orphan House,
Messrs. Habersham and Barber, wrote him letters respecting
a remarkable religious movement among the children there.
Two young men, employed on the estate, had been converted
since Whitefield left; and a number of the children had been
put into two bands, and were "allowed to spend two or three
hours every day in reading, praying, and singing hymns
together." One day, Joseph Periam left them in the school
picking cotton, when one of them exclaimed, "If we do
not believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall all go to
hell." At once, the entire company fell upon their knees,
and began to pray, "Lord God Almighty, have compassion
upon us. Prick us to the heart. Pluck us as firebrands
out of the burning. O Lord Jesus Christ, wash us in Thy
blood. Take away our hard, stony hearts, and give us
hearts of flesh." No wonder that Habersham wrote to
Whitefield, saying, "Does not your soul leap for joy, and
say, 'Bless the Lord, O my friends, and let us magnify His
name together'?"<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Gilbert Tennent, also, wrote to Whitefield as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, <em>April 25, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Very dear Brother</span>,&mdash;In my return homewards, I have been
preaching daily, ordinarily three times a day, and sometimes oftener.
Through grace, I have met with success much exceeding my expectations.
In Boston, there were many hundreds, if not thousands, under soul-concern.
When I left that place, many children were deeply affected, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
several had received consolation. Some aged persons in church communion,
and some open opposers, were convinced; and divers of the young
and middle-aged, together with several negroes, were converted. At
Charleston, multitudes were awakened. At Cambridge, in the college
and town, the shaking among the dry bones was general; and several of
the students have received consolation. In these places, I found fruits of
your ministry. In Ipswich, there was a general concern among the
inhabitants; and here, also, I saw some of the results of your labours.
The concern at Newport was very considerable. Divers Quakers and
children, with others, came to me, in distress about their souls. At
Newhaven, the concern was general, both in the college and town. About
thirty students came, on foot, ten miles to hear the word of God. I
believe thousands have been awakened. Glory be to God on high!</p>

<p>"I thank you, sir, that you did excite me to this journey. The work of
God spreads more and more. My brother William has had remarkable
success this winter at Burlington. I hear that there are several Religious
Societies formed there. Mr. John Cross has had great success at Staten
Island; and many have been awakened by the labours of Mr. Rollinson
in divers places of the York government. Mr. Mills has had much success
in Connecticut; and Mr. Blair, in Pennsylvania. The Lord bless you,
dear brother!</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>Six months ago, Whitefield had persuaded Gilbert
Tennent to become, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tempore</i>, an intinerant preacher;
and now such was the evangelist's report of his success.
Whitefield had consolations, as well as trials. "As cold
waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country"
(Prov. xxv. 26).</p>

<p>After his arrival from America, Whitefield remained about
six weeks in London, during which, he employed himself
in preaching to diminished congregations on Kennington
Common, and in Moorfields. He was also summoned to
"the Parliament House" to give evidence on Georgia affairs;
and also urged his "appeal" against the decision of Commissary
Garden's Court in Charleston. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"London, April 10, 1741. I have been at the Parliament-house. The
Georgia affair was adjourned. The gentlemen seemed apprehensive that
my account of the colony would have too much weight. It was somewhat
of a trial to be in the House. My 'Appeal' will come to nothing, I
believe. I have waited upon the Speaker. He received me kindly."<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>On April 22, Whitefield left London for Bristol, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
he remained a week. The following letters were written
during this brief visit; the first and second to friends in
London, the third probably to Howell Harris.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Bristol</span>, <em>April 25, 1741</em>.

<em>in-being</em> of sin. He now asserts it is <em>impossible</em> for <em>him</em> to sin. I talked
with three women. One said she had been perfect these twelve months;
but, alas! she shewed many marks of imperfection whilst I was with her.
I asked her if she had any pride. She said, 'No.' I asked if she ever
prayed for pardon, at night, for her sins and infirmities. She said, 'No;
for she did not commit any sin.' I spoke to another woman, who said
she had not sinned in thought, word, or deed, this twelvemonth. I asked
her, and every one of the rest, whether they ever used the Lord's Prayer.
They were unwilling to answer, but afterwards said, 'Yes.' I asked them
whether they used it for themselves, and could say, 'Forgive us our trespasses.'
They said, 'No; they used it for others only.'"<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p></blockquote>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,&mdash;Blessed be God for knitting us together in love!
It is now a trying time with the church. Our Lord is now chiefly wounded
in the house of His friends. The Lord keep us both from a party spirit
on one hand, and from too much rashness and positiveness on the other!
I speak thus, because you seem offended that some affirm, 'there is
no such thing as dominion over indwelling sin, nor rest from working for
life wholly.' Now this is certainly true in one sense. We shall never
have such a dominion over indwelling sin as to be entirely delivered from
the stirring of it; and the greatest saint cannot be assured, but, some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
or other, for his humiliation or punishment for unfaithfulness, God may
permit it to break out into some actual breach of His law, and in a gross
way too. Let us not be high-minded, but fear. It is equally true, that we
shall not rest wholly from working for life; for, whilst there is any part of
us unregenerate, that part will be always leading us to the old covenant.
But I suppose you have been tinctured with the doctrine of <em>sinless perfection</em>.
No wonder, therefore, you write thus. As for <em>assurance</em>, I cannot
but think, all who are truly converted must know that there was a time in
which they closed with Christ; but, then, as so many have died with only
a humble hope, and have been under doubts and fears, though they could
not but be looked upon as Christians, I am less positive than once I was,
lest haply I should condemn some of God's dear children. The farther
we go in the spiritual life, the more cool and rational shall we be, and yet
more truly zealous. I speak this by experience.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>Passing by the question of Whitefield's orthodoxy, it may
be added, that, though his friend Charles Wesley was in
Bristol at this period, and was preaching with great success,
there seems to have been no intercourse between them.
In Whitefield's letters, Wesley is not mentioned; and, in
Wesley's Journals, there is no allusion to Whitefield, except,
perhaps, in the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1741. May 4. I met the bands in Kingswood. One, who, in the fear
of God, and mistrust of himself, had heard Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, assured me, he
had preached barefaced reprobation. The people fled from the reprobating
lion. But, again and again, as he observed them depart, the
preacher of sad tidings called them back, with general offers of salvation.
Vain and empty offers indeed! What availed his telling them that, for
<em>aught he knew</em>, they might be <em>all</em> elect? He did not believe them all
elect; he could not: therefore, he only mocked them with an empty word
of invitation; and if God sent him to preach the gospel to every <em>creature</em>,
God, according to his scheme, sent him to <em>deceive</em> the greatest part of
mankind."<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Charles Wesley regarded Whitefield's Calvinism with abhorrence;
and Whitefield regarded some of Wesley's doctrines
as pernicious heresy. In a letter, dated "Gloucester, May 5,
1741," Whitefield writes: "At Bristol, error is in a great
measure put a stop to." And, in another, dated "Bristol,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
May 16, 1741, he says: "Sad tares have been sown here.
It will require some time to pluck them up. The doctrines
of the gospel are sadly run down, and most monstrous
errors propagated. They assert, that, 'the very in-being of
sin must be taken out of us, or otherwise we are not new
creatures.' Oh, dear sir, exhort all to pray for us, that I may
be faithful to my Lord, and yet be kept gentle in my temper.
At present, our dear Lord causes me to triumph in every
place."</p>

<p>After paying a short visit to Gloucester, Whitefield returned
to Bristol, where he continued till the end of the
month of May. There can be no doubt, that, at this time,
the Bristol Methodists marshalled themselves under two
different banners. Whitefield and Charles Wesley were in
the city, but there is no evidence that they ever sought
each other's company. Whitefield, as he thought, was successfully
plucking up the tares that his former friends, the
Wesleys, had sown; and Charles Wesley was labouring with
all his might to destroy Whitefield's doctrine of reprobation.
He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"May 19. I am more and more confirmed in the truth by its miserable
opposers. I talked lately with Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;," (Humphreys?)<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> "and urged
him with this dilemma: 'For what did God make this reprobate&mdash;to be
damned, or to be saved?' He durst not say that God made even Judas
to be damned, and would not say that God made him to be saved. I
desired to know for what third end He could make him; but all the
answer I could get was, 'It is not a fair question.' Next I asked,
'Whether he that believeth not shall be damned, because he believeth
not?' 'Yes,' he answered; and I replied, 'Because he believeth
not what?' Here he hesitated, and I was forced to help him out with
the Apostle's answer, 'That they all might be damned who believed not
the truth.' 'What truth?' I asked again, 'but the truth of the gospel
of <em>their</em> salvation? If it is not the gospel of <em>their</em> salvation, and yet they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
are bound to believe it, then they are bound to believe a lie, under pain of
damnation; and the Apostle should have said, 'That they all might be
damned who believed <em>not a lie</em>.' This drove him to assert, that no man
was damned for <em>actual</em> unbelief, but only for what he called <em>original</em>;
that is, for not believing before he was born. 'But where,' said I, 'is the
justice of this?' He answered, not over-hastily, 'I confess there is a
mystery in reprobation.' Or, to put it in Beza's words, which I then read
him, 'We believe, though it is incomprehensible, that it is just to damn
such as do not deserve it.' Further, I asked him, 'Why does God command
all men everywhere to repent? Why does He call, and offer His
grace to, reprobates? Why does His Spirit strive with every child of man
for <em>some</em> time, though not always?' I could get no answer, and so read
him one of his friend Calvin's: 'God speaketh to them, that they may be
the deafer; He gives light to them, that they may be the blinder; He
offers instruction to them, that they may be the more ignorant; and uses
the remedy, that they may <em>not</em> be healed' (Calvin, Instit. l. iii., c. 24).
Never did I meet with a more pitiful advocate of a more pitiful cause.
And, yet, I believe he could say as much for reprobation as another. I
told him <em>his</em> predestination had got a millstone about its neck, and would
infallibly be drowned, if he did not part it from reprobation."<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The two Methodist leaders felt strongly on the subject of
their respective doctrines; and that their partisans were
quite as zealous as their leaders will be evident from the
following extracts from Charles Wesley's Journal, written at
and about the time of Whitefield's visit to Bristol:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"May 25. While I was passing by the Bowling-green, a woman cried
out, 'The curse of God light upon you,' with such uncommon bitterness,
that I could not but turn and stop to bless her. When I asked her why
she cursed me, she answered, 'For preaching against Mr. &mdash;&mdash;.' I had,
indeed, a suspicion, from her dialect, that she was one of the self-elect;
but stayed heaping coals of fire upon her head, till at last she said, 'God
bless you all!'</p>

<p>"May 31. To several, God shewed Himself the God of consolation;
particularly to two young Welshmen, whom His providence sent hither
from Carmarthen. They had heard most dreadful stories of us Arminians,
Freewillers, Perfectionists, Papists, which all vanished like smoke when
they came to hear with their own ears.</p>

<p>"June 8. A woman spoke to me of her husband. He was under
strong convictions, while he attended the word; but the first time he
heard the <em>other gospel</em>, he came home <em>elect</em>, and, in proof of it, <em>beat his
wife</em>. His seriousness was at an end. His work was done. God doth
not behold iniquity in Jacob. He uses his wife worse than a Turk (his
predestinarian brother), and tells her, if he killed her he could not be
damned."</p></blockquote>

<p>Charles Wesley was far more alarmed by the Calvinian
controversy than his brother John. The following letter,
kindly supplied by Mr. G. Stampe, of Grimsby, has not
before been published. It is addressed "To the Rev. Mr.
Wesley, at Mr. Hooper's, maltster, Bristol," and is endorsed,
in John's handwriting, "September 28, 1741. In a panic
about G. W." It begins abruptly, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Extract of a letter from Bristol.&mdash;'I am exceedingly afraid lest predestination
should be propagated among us in a more subtle and
dangerous manner than has hitherto been attempted. Mr. Whitefield
preaches holiness very strongly, and "free grace" to all; yet, at the same
time, he uses expressions which necessarily imply reprobation. He wraps
it up in smoother language than before, in order to convey the poison
more successfully. Our Society, on this account, go to hear him, without
any scruple or dread. We have sufficiently seen the fatal effects of this
devilish doctrine already, so that we cannot keep at too great a distance
from it. For my part, by the grace of God, I never will be reconciled
to reprobation, nor join with those who hold it. I wish there might be
a <em>real</em> and <em>thorough</em> union betwixt us.'</p>

<p>"O thou eternal Phrygian! I am too full to write or speak! Do you
know the value of souls! precious, immortal souls! yet trust them within
the sound of predestination? This is outdoing your own outdoings.
Stop the plague <em>just now</em>, or it will be too late. Send me word, first post,
that you have warned our flock from going to hear the other's gospel.
O how you are outwitted! The subtle Scots<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> (those sons of Zeruiah) are
too hard for you. I pity you and those few sheep in the wilderness, who
are left to the wolf. For mine, and your own, and theirs, and Christ's
sake, open your eyes; regard not fair speeches; renounce your credulity
and George Whitefield, till he renounces reprobation. 'But that he does
already, and preaches holiness and free grace for all!' And are you,
can you be so easily caught? O that virtue of credulity! Send me
word, I say, by next post, that you have restrained the unwary; or I
shall, on the first preaching night, renounce George Whitefield on the
house-top.</p>

<p>"P.S. When it was told the Grand Turk that all the princes of
Christendom were entering into a confederacy against him, he answered,
'When these fingers are joined,' (holding them up,) 'then will the Christians
agree.' So the world may say concerning our Societies and the
Predestinarians joining against them.</p>

<p>"I have received a letter from Mr. Hutchins, of Lincoln College, with
an order upon his brother to pay you £12 (I think it is). You should
send me your order to receive it.</p>

<p>These extracts furnish glimpses of a lamentable state of
things in Bristol, where, within the last three years, both
Whitefield and the Wesleys had witnessed some of their
most glorious triumphs. Old friends were divided, and
loving Christians had become furious partisans. In the midst
of this unhallowed strife, Whitefield wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Bristol, May 16, 1741. I rejoice that God lets you see more and more
into the corruptions of your heart. The more perfect you are, the more
you will see and bewail your imperfections in thought, word, and deed;
the more will you be able to sing, 'In the Lord alone, and not in myself,
have I complete righteousness and strength.' The doctrine of electing
love is precious to my soul. I am enabled to speak of it feelingly to
others. My soul is kept in peace and sweetness. Our Lord's cause needs
not noise and rashness. I desire that none of my wild-fire may be mixed
with the pure fire of holy zeal coming from God's altar. Brother H&mdash;&mdash;"
(Humphreys?)" is more and more enlightened; but, withal, more and
more quickened every day. He finds there is no such thing as <em>sinless</em>
perfection, and yet is pressing after holiness of heart and life rather more
than ever."</p>

<p>"Bristol, May 18, 1741. I am just setting out for Wiltshire. The
Lord has been much with us. Yesterday, I preached three times. At
every sermon, a sweet melting was observed in the congregation. Last
evening, I gave your sister the sacrament. She is recovering. I afterwards
administered the sacrament at Mr. T&mdash;&mdash;'s, and had a love-feast.
Jesus was in the midst of us. I know not but I may come towards
London next week. I wonder not at your heaviness. Before every
increase of your work, you must expect some trials. Humblings are
necessary for your spirit, and mine." (Extract from a letter to John
Cennick.)</p>

<p>"Bristol, May 23, 1741. The Lord only knows how He will be pleased
to dispose of me. Great afflictions I am sure of having; and a sudden
death, blessed be God! will not be terrible. I know that my Redeemer
liveth. I every day long to see Him, and enjoy Him without interruption
for evermore. I desire patiently to wait, till my blessed change shall
come. The Lord has been with me here. There is a great awakening
in Wiltshire; and the work is most wonderfully carried on in New
England. I leave Bristol, and go, through Wiltshire, to London, next
Monday. I then purpose going to Staffordshire, and then, through Wales,
to Scotland. A wider door than ever is opened for preaching the everlasting
gospel."</p>

<p>"Bristol, May 23, 1741. I thank you and the other gentlemen for their
kind invitation to me to Scotland. I believe it will be near three months
before I can see Edinburgh. On Monday, I set out for London; then I
purpose to go into Essex, and then to return through Bristol and Wales
in my way to you. I intreat all my brethren to pray for me, that I may
come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ. I am a poor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
weak, unworthy worm. God has been with me here, and in Gloucestershire.
In Wiltshire there is a great awakening. Oh, dear sir, never was a
weak wretch sent on such an important errand. I have many trials, of
various kinds. Jesus supports me; Jesus makes me more than conqueror.
Dear sir, help me to praise Him."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield and Wesley now had not only separate congregations,
but separate meeting-houses. In Bristol, Wesley
occupied the chapel which he had built in Broadmead; and
in Kingswood, the school-room which had been begun by
Whitefield, and completed by himself. As yet, Whitefield
had no chapel in Bristol; but, in Kingswood, John Cennick
and others assisted him in building a room near the one
which Wesley used.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> In London, Wesley had converted the
ruinous old Foundery, near Moorfields, into a place of worship;
and now, in 1741, the friends of Whitefield procured
a piece of ground close to Wesley's Foundery, and employed
a carpenter to build a large temporary shed to screen his
Moorfields congregations from the cold and rain. It is a
curious fact, that, Whitefield never mentions this erection till
it was ready to be opened. Its promoters were Calvinistic
Dissenters; and originally it was only intended to be used
during the few months he might stay in England, prior to
his return to Georgia. Providence, however, had otherwise
determined. Notwithstanding its unseemly proximity to
Wesley's Foundery, within this wooden fabric, of large
dimensions, immense crowds were gathered; a great spiritual
awakening took place; a Society was formed; and, during
Whitefield's absence, and at the desire of the people, Messrs.
Cennick, Adams, Jenkins, Howell Harris, Seagrave, Humphreys,
and others, were employed to assist in carrying on
the worship, in succession.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> Two facts respecting this original
tabernacle must be remembered: 1. It sprang, not from
Whitefield, but from a voluntary movement among his
adherents, composed chiefly, if not wholly, of Protestant
Dissenters; and, 2. The expense of its erection was borne,
not by him, but by them. For twelve years, this wooden
shed was Whitefield's metropolitan cathedral. As will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
seen hereafter, the history of its society and congregations
was chequered; but still, beneath its roof, there were many
displays of God's abounding mercy. In 1753, it was superseded
by the erection, on the same site, of the substantial
brick building which, for more than a hundred years, was
used by Whitefield's successors.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>This uncouth structure seems to have been opened for
public worship about a month after Whitefield's return from
America; for, on April 19, 1741, he made collections in it,
for his Orphan House, amounting to £23 11s. 1d.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> It is mentioned
in the following letters, the first to James Habersham,
at the Orphan House in Georgia, and the second to John
Cennick, Whitefield's <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locum tenens</i>, at Bristol.</p>

appears much in our congregations. We seldom have a dry meeting.
As to outward things, I never was more embarrassed; but my consolations
are equivalent. Praise the Lord, O my soul! I am not apprehensive
of any opposition from Government. I have waited on the Speaker. He
treated me kindly, and assured me that there would be no persecution in
this king's reign.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> They know I am loyal from principle; but, I believe,

<p>To all intents and purposes, Whitefield was now a Dissenting
minister. In America, his ministerial associates
and friends were almost, without exception, Nonconformists.
In England, nearly all the churches were closed against him.
Protestant Dissenters had built him a wooden chapel, and,
without either the ground or the edifice being rendered
sacred by episcopal benedictions, Whitefield became its chief
minister. Yea, more, like his friend Wesley, obtaining no
help from the English clergy, he hesitated not to employ laymen
to occupy his pulpit during his evangelistic wanderings.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"All," says he, "was wonderfully over-ruled for good, and for the
furtherance of the gospel. A fresh awakening immediately began. Congregations
grew exceeding large; and necessity reconciling me more and
more to lay-preaching, I sent, at the people's desire, for Messrs. Cennick,
Harris, Seagrave, Humphreys, and others, to assist." (M. S.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Howell Harris was the first that Whitefield invited to
supply his place in London. Hence the following, written
soon after the Tabernacle was opened:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>June 6, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Brother Howell Harris</span>,&mdash;I do assure you that my heart is
as your heart. I am quite sick of <em>Christless consenters</em>. They talk, and
that is all. I, like you, am heartily despised by most of them. I am
resolved to preach against their lukewarmness and worldly-mindedness.
May God open my mouth wide when I come to Wales! Outward
enemies are now more quiet. Enemies within the church&mdash;carnal professors
and self-righteous Pharisees&mdash;most try us. Let us not fear. Jesus
Christ will give us the victory over all.</p>

<p>"God mightily strengthens me. Our congregations are very large and
solemn. I never had greater freedom in preaching.</p>

<p>"You need not fear my believing any reports to your disadvantage. I
love you in the bowels of Jesus Christ. I was not in the least offended
when B&mdash;&mdash; H&mdash;&mdash; wrote me word that 'you thought in some things I
did not act as a <em>little child</em>.' The more open you are with me the better.
If nature and pride rise in my heart, I will go to Jesus, abhor myself, and
pray for my dear reprovers.</p>

<p>"I want to see you face to face. Satan does not love that Christ's
ministers should come together. I wish you could come up immediately,
and stay in London whilst I am in the country; or, rather, go and preach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
in Bristol, Gloucester, and Wiltshire, for about a fortnight, and then come
up to London. This, I believe, will be best. About that time, God
willing, I shall return from Essex; and then we can consult what is best
to be done for the cause of our dear Master. I am glad to hear that
Brother Rowlands is with you. Go on, in the strength of our dear Lord,
and you shall see Satan, like lightning, fall from heaven. Times are not
yet dark enough for the dawning of a thorough reformation. At eventide,
God speaks.</p>

<p>"Cease not to pray for yours eternally in Christ Jesus,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The "brother Rowlands," mentioned in this letter, was
probably the Rev. Daniel Rowlands, Rector of Llangeitho,
in the county of Cardigan. Rowlands was a remarkable
man. He entered the ministry of the Establisment when
unconverted, and was wont to descend from his pulpit to
join in the athletic games of his parishioners. Through
curiosity, he went to hear Griffith Jones; became a changed
man; and began to preach, "like thunder," among the Welsh
mountains. This was about the year 1737. Like Whitefield,
he became an itinerant clergyman. Besides serving his
own Church, for a salary of £10 a year, he made frequent
detours through the mountainous regions of Wales and into
England, preaching in the Methodist chapels, in the open
air, and wherever he had a chance. Multitudes followed
him from town to town; and his overwhelming eloquence
often kindled an enthusiasm which it is difficult to describe.
Whitefield writes: "The power of God, under the ministry
of Mr. Rowlands, was enough to make a person's heart burn
within him. At seven in the morning, have I seen perhaps
ten thousand from different parts, in the midst of a sermon,
crying, <em>Gogoniant!</em> (Glory!) ready to leap for joy." Even
when repeating the Church service, tears and convulsive
sobs, followed by cries of <em>Gogoniant</em>, would break out, and
run through the multitude like a contagious fever. As early
as 1746, Rowlands had as many as three thousand communicants
to whom he was accustomed to administer the
sacrament.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> At length, his irregular labours evoked warnings
from his bishop, and, at last, his license was rescinded.
"And now," says an able writer in the <cite>London Quarterly</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
<cite>Review</cite> (1849), "from every part of Wales&mdash;from the mouth
of the Wye up to the Dovey and the Conway&mdash;people
flocked to hear the eloquence, and to receive the sacrament
from the hands, of one who had acquired the dignity of a
martyr."</p>

<p>This is not the place for further details of the life of
Daniel Rowlands. The reader will meet with him again;
but, it may be added, that, in a preface to three of his
sermons, published in 1778, (8vo. 98 pp.,) it is stated that,
"for about forty years," he had been "the most laborious
and successful minister in Wales;" and that he still travelled
"through most of the counties yearly, to spread abroad the
riches of God's grace." No places, though some were very
large, were sufficient "to hold his auditories. Above a
hundred preachers in Wales esteemed him as their father,
most of whom met him four times a year to consult about
the most likely means of promoting the Redeemer's interests;
and he administered the Lord's supper to thousands monthly,
some of the communicants coming a distance of upwards of
fifty miles."</p>

<p>In the foregoing letter, to Howell Harris, Whitefield says,
"Outward enemies are now more quiet." Compared with
the opposition encountered in previous years, this was true;
but the "outward enemies" were not entirely silent. One
of the pamphlets published against him was the following:
"A Comparison between the Doctrines taught by the Clergy
of the Church of England, and the Doctrines taught by
Whitefield, Seagrave, and others: in which the true notion of
preaching Christ is stated; the doctrinal preaching of the
Established Church is vindicated; and the Methodists proved
guilty of not preaching the Gospel of Christ. To which is
added, the Wisdom of fleeing from Persecution, exemplified
in the Conduct of the Rev. Mr. Whitefield at Charleston,
in South Carolina. London: 1741." (8vo. 28 pp.)</p>

<p>The <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>, also, ministered to the gratification
of its readers by scurrility like the following. After
pointing out the doctrinal differences between Wesley and
Whitefield, it continued:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is plain that one of them has a lying spirit; and, since their pretences
are so much alike, we may conclude that it is the same spirit in both.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
The controversy has grown to so great a height, that Mr. Whitefield tells
his auditors, that, if they follow Mr. Wesley's doctrines, they will be
<em>damned, eternally damned</em>. On the other hand, Mr. Wesley tells his
congregations, that, if they follow Mr. Whitefield, it will bring all to
<em>distraction and confusion</em> at last. Now, here is oracle against oracle,
revelation against revelation, and the God of truth in one is declared to be
a liar, by what He mentions in the other" (p. 321).</p></blockquote>

<p>The <cite>Weekly Miscellany</cite>, as usual, excelled all other
publications by the grossness and violence of its personal
abuse. In the numbers for March 14, 21, 28, there were
long leading articles against Whitefield. Throughout the
whole of April, there were similar articles against Wesley.
On May 2, both Whitefield and Wesley were vigorously
attacked, and the opinion was expressed, that, "they are
privately set on by popish emissaries, to promote their
interests, and to take advantage of our being engaged in a
war abroad to raise disturbance at home; and, in the end,
to bring in the Pretender upon us, and so to involve us in
blood, ruin, and confusion, to the utter subversion of both
church and state."</p>

<p>These mendacious onslaughts were continued every week
up to June 27, when Mr. Hooper's infamous <cite>Weekly Miscellany</cite>
expired, and was succeeded by the <cite>New Weekly
Miscellany, or Westminster Journal</cite>. As a specimen of its
final foamings against Whitefield, the following is taken from
its concluding number:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Observations on Mr. Whitefield's conduct in America.&mdash;Mr. Hooker,&mdash;You
have heard in all the public prints of the designed insurrection of
the blacks in New York, to murder all the English on that continent,&mdash;how
many houses they set on fire with that intention,&mdash;how they armed
themselves with guns and knives for that purpose,&mdash;how near they were
to execute their design,&mdash;with what difficulty it was suppressed,&mdash;how
many persons have been executed upon that account,&mdash;and how many are
still in prison in order to take their trials for that bloody conspiracy.</p>

<p>"What I submit to your consideration is, how far Mr. Whitefield has
been instrumental in bringing this about. He tells us, in his Journals,
how he has travelled above fourteen hundred miles in America, particularly
to Pennsylvania, New England, New York, Rhode Island, and South
Carolina: and that, in all these places, he has taken care to inveigh
against the clergy of the Church of England; that he has frequently
preached in the dissenting meetings, and has been carressed by their
teachers. Now the consequence of all this is to raise feuds and animosities
among ourselves. Mr. Whitefield has contended very strenuously for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
conversion and baptizing of the negroes. The design is good, if well
managed; but it does not appear that he made much application to the
<em>planters</em>, their masters, who ought principally to be consulted. For the
education of the negroes, he has purchased five thousand acres of land in
Pennsylvania, which he has taken care to settle, upon himself and his heirs
for ever, for that purpose."</p></blockquote>

<p>By such perversions and insinuations, this malignant
writer proceeds to assert, that, one result of Whitefield's
preaching has been to make the negroes discontented and
turbulent, so "that all the planters are forced to be doubly
on their guard, and are not sure, when they go to bed, but
that they shall have their throats cut before the next
morning. The same preaching may be the overturning of
several of the colonies. How far Mr. Whitefield is answerable
before God, for the consequences of these proceedings,
must be left to his own conscience to determine."</p>

<p>It is remarkable, that, in the very midst of these weekly
libellous attacks, Whitefield placidly remarks, "Outward
enemies are now more quiet." Their falsehoods and bitterness
were now comparatively disregarded. He had become
accustomed to violent abuse, and, in defiance of it, went on
his way rejoicing. He had foes, but he also had friends.
To John Cennick, at Kingswood, he wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>June 8, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,&mdash;How sweetly does Providence order all things
for us! Just before yours came, I was resolved to send you £20, to begin
the Society Room at Kingswood. Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; gives it, and, I believe,
will make it fifty. This gentlewoman has been made instrumental in
relieving me out of my late distress. You know how I was threatened to
be arrested, soon after my arrival, for above £300, due on account of the
Orphan House in Georgia. This drove me to my knees. The example
of Professor Francke encouraged me to pray. God was pleased to give
me an answer of peace. Having, as I thought, a full assurance of
immediate help, I went to sleep most comfortably. Early the next
morning, a friend came to enquire, if I knew where a gentlewoman of his
acquaintance might put out three or four hundred pounds. I replied, Let
her lend it to me, and, in a few months, God willing, she shall have it
again. Upon being acquainted with my circumstances, she most cheerfully
lent me the sum I wanted. Praise the Lord, O my soul!</p>

<p>"I would have you lay the foundation" (of the Society Room at Kingswood)
"immediately; but take care of building too large or too handsome.
Notwithstanding my present embarrassments, who knows but it may be
in my power to discharge my Orphan-house debt, and make collections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
here for Kingswood School too? When I could get no assistance from my
old friends, and spiritual, prejudiced children, and was almost quite penniless,
a serious person, whom I never saw or heard of, came the other day
and put a guinea into my hand. On receiving it, something, as it were,
said to me, 'Cannot that God who sent this person to give thee this
guinea, make it up fifteen hundred?' As I told a friend immediately, to
whom I ran down, so I shall tell you, I doubt not that this will be the
case. My debt is all for God, and contracted in providing for the fatherless
and widow.</p>

<p>"As to the work here, though perhaps I may be blamed by some for
venturing so far, blessed be God, it goes on sweetly. All things happen
for the furtherance of the gospel.</p>

The heat of the battle is now, I hope, pretty well over. God is pleased to
give me great power, and to strengthen me both in body and soul. Our
congregations are large and awful. We generally see and feel much of
the Divine presence in the sanctuary. Many are pricked to the heart. I
have three truly experienced young men who have joined me.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Affairs
being somewhat settled here, I am going a long journey of several months,
through several counties in England, Wales, and Scotland. The door was
never opened wider for my preaching the everlasting gospel.</p>

<p>"At present, there is no great fear of opposition from the men in power;
though I hear the House of Lords intend to give a hearing to my appeal.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
However it be, I am easy. The Lord Jesus over-rules everything for the
good of His church.</p>

<p>"I suppose I cannot come over to you till about next spring. In the
meanwhile, I am, etc.,</p>

"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>From the letter Whitefield wrote to Cennick, it is evident
he was still seriously in debt on account of his orphans in
America; but he was full of faith that God would provide
for his necessities. His confidence was not misplaced. On
the 11th of June, Mr. Habersham, his superintendent, wrote
to him, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You would be surprised to see Bethesda. God has given us the
appearance of a plentiful crop. The garden and plantation now afford us
many comfortable things, and in great plenty. Our stores are well stocked
with flour and beef. The house would be soon finished, if we could get
bricks. J. S&mdash;&mdash; is ready to do all our bricklayers' work <em>gratis</em>. Brother
W&mdash;&mdash; is a great blessing to the family, and has spun and woven a great
deal for us. All the boys now sleep in the great house. They have also
coats, and lie in sheets of their own making. By this means, they are
kept sweet and clean. We have a fine growing stock of cattle; and, if
God should so order it that we should have a plantation in Carolina, we
should need but little, if any, assistance from abroad. If our building
were now done, our expenses would be trifling to what they have been."<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Besides cheering intelligence like this, Whitefield began
to receive considerable assistance from friends in England.
On one day, June 13, 1741, he had occasion to write to
three different clergymen, thanking them for their contributions.
To the "Rev. Mr. U&mdash;&mdash;" he says: "Dear sir, I most
heartily thank you for promising me your assistance in
respect to the orphans. I am persuaded our Lord will be
well pleased. He gives me great encouragement." To the
"Rev. Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, at Worcester," he writes: "As you are
so aged and infirm, I take it as an especial favour that you
are pleased to write to me. You need make no apology,
reverend sir, for your plain dealing. I love those best, who
deal most sincerely with me. I also thank you for your
kind benefaction. My arrears upon the Orphan House are
yet large; but, I hope, ere long, the Lord will enable me to
pay them all. At present, I am kept from doubting." And
to the third clergyman, "the Rev. Mr. F&mdash;&mdash;, at Southampton,"
he says, with a characteristic gush of gratitude, "Just
now I have received your kind letter, and the generous
benefaction of you and your friends for the Orphan House.
It came very opportunely, and strengthens my faith in the
blessed Jesus. I find He helps me by ways I know not."</p>

<p>Towards the end of June, Whitefield left London, to
preach in the provinces, and to make collections for his
Orphanage.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> In a letter to John Cennick, dated "Hertford,
July I, 1741," he says:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"I have been enabled to preach twice every day, and to ride several
miles. The congregations have been everywhere very large. God's
presence has accompanied the word. People's hearts have been enlarged.
Within these few days, we have collected near £100 for the poor orphans.
Numbers of souls, I believe, are under convictions. In some places, we
have had near ten thousand hearers."</p></blockquote>

<p>In another letter, written at Colchester, eleven days later,
he tells Mr. Habersham, "I have been a circuit into Hertfordshire,
Essex, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and Suffolk.
The word is attended with power, and the alarm in the
country greater than ever. Contributions increase. I am
more and more convinced that evangelizing is my proper
business at present."</p>

<p>In a third letter, addressed to "Mr. Howell Harris,
at Mr. Syms's, in the Paved Alley, Leadenhall Market,
London," and which has not heretofore been published,
Whitefield wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Coggeshall</span>, <em>July 13, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"I must snatch a few moments to write to my dear brother Howell.
I rejoice to hear that the Lord is with you. May He cause all opposition
to fall before you! He has been doing great things for me since I left
London. Surely you pray for me. I am much strengthened in body and
soul. On Wednesday night, I hope to be in London, and to preach in
the Tabernacle on Thursday evening. May the Lord sanctify our meeting!
I must away to preach. The clock strikes ten. Adieu!</p>

<p class="sig">
"Your affectionate brother and servant,<br />

"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>In a fourth letter, dated July 18, he writes: "God has
mightily blessed my journey in the country. Thousands
and tens of thousands have flocked to hear the word, and
near £180 have been collected for the Orphan House."</p>

<p>It is a curious fact, that Whitefield's congregations and
large collections were represented as a national evil. In
the <cite>New Weekly Miscellany</cite>, for August 8, 1741, Richard
Hooker wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"About a fortnight ago, the Rev. Mr. Whitefield returned to London,
from his progress of three weeks through the counties of Hertford, Essex,
Bedford, Cambridge, and Suffolk, during which time he preached six-and-forty
times, with such good success, that the common enemy may guess
thereby what mobs may be raised, in these and other places, to disturb
the kingdom, whenever there is occasion. In his journeys, he collected
upwards of £180 for the Orphan House in Georgia; and, on Sunday, the
19th of July, in the morning, he had a collection at his New Booth in
London, where there were several half-guineas, and other sums of lesser
value given; but what was collected in the whole is uncertain; only it is
observed, that whatever money is sent out of the nation in a time of war,
when taxes are so high, and trade decays, is a weakening of the public.
And, as the old proverb saith, 'Every little helps' to bring on the common
calamity, all this looks like a judicial infatuation, at a time when we have
so many real objects of charity in our own kingdom. It is observable, that
he pays in none of this money to the trustees for Georgia; so that he
hath no vouchers for what he receives, and is accountable to no one, but
as he sees fit. And as the late famous Jonathan Wild, the thief-catcher,
had a correspondent in Holland, one Johnson, who received from him
such goods as he could not sell in England, so the Rev. Mr. Whitefield
hath one, Habersham, in Georgia, to receive all such money as he knows
not how otherwise to dispose of."</p></blockquote>

<p>Enough for the present of the redoubtable Richard
Hooker. Whitefield, forsooth, was endangering the nation!
And Jonathan Wild might have claimed him as a suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
companion! Abuse like this was far from pleasant; but
Mr. Hooker found it difficult to exist without bespattering
his neighbours.</p>

<p>Whitefield's Dissenting friends had built him a large
"New Booth," as Mr. Hooker politely called the Tabernacle;
but his restless zeal could not be confined within limits so
contracted. Wesley, though ecclesiastically irregular in his
ministerial labours, most rigidly refrained from identifying
himself with Nonconformists. Whitefield, on the other
hand, wished to be the helper of all Christian denominations.
The following letter, to Joseph Humphreys, deserves
attention:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Coggeshall</span>, <em>July 13, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"I received your letter at Bury; but cannot think that matters are
quite ripe, or that you are duly qualified for settling a church. God lets
me see, more and more, that I must evangelize. I find you are for
settling. Do as God shall direct: I am easy. I only wish you may find
settled persons to be your assistants. Without this, a church cannot be
rightly ordered. I have no freedom, but in <em>going about to all denominations</em>.
I cannot join with any one, so as to be fixed in any particular
place. Every one has his proper gift. Field-preaching is my place.
In this, I am carried as on eagles' wings. God makes way for me everywhere."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, already, Whitefield had determined the plan which
he steadfastly pursued to the end of life. He was an
ordained clergyman of the Church of England; but was
always ready to preach for any other church whatever. In
this respect, there was always a marked difference between
him and his friends John and Charles Wesley. For this,
he had been partly trained in England, but especially in
America, where his preaching labours had been chiefly in
connection with Nonconformist churches, and had been
greatly blessed.</p>

<p>On July 24th, Whitefield embarked, at Gravesend, for
Scotland, where he landed six days afterwards. During the
voyage, he wrote twenty-seven letters, ten of which were to
boys and girls in his Orphan House. One of the letters,
addressed to "the Students under conviction at the Colleges
of Cambridge and Newhaven, in New England and Connecticut,"
must close the present chapter:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;With unspeakable pleasure I have heard,<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> that
there seems to be a general concern among you about the things of God.
It was no small grief to me, that I was obliged to say of your college, that
'your light was become darkness.' I heartily thank God for sending
dear Mr. Tennent among you. What great things may we not now expect
to see in New England, since it hath pleased God to work so
remarkably among the sons of the prophets? Now we may expect a
reformation indeed, since it is beginning at the house of God.</p>

<p>"A dead ministry will always make a dead people. Whereas, if
ministers are warmed with the love of God themselves, they cannot but
be instruments of diffusing that love among others. This, this is the best
preparation for the work whereunto you are called. Learning without
piety will only make you more capable of promoting the kingdom of Satan.
Henceforward, therefore, I hope you will enter into your studies, not to
get a parish, nor to be polite preachers, but to be great saints. This,
indeed, is the most compendious way to true learning; for, an understanding
enlightened by the Spirit of God is more susceptible of divine
truths, and, I am certain, will prove most useful to mankind. The more
holy you are, the more will God delight to honour you. He loves to
make use of instruments which are like Himself. I hope that the <em>good
old divinity</em> will now be precious to your souls, and that you will think
it an honour to tread in the steps of your pious forefathers. They were
acquainted with their own hearts, and, therefore, from their own experience,
they knew how to succour others. O may you follow them, as they
followed Christ!</p>

<p>"I trust you will not be offended at me for sending you these few lines.
I write out of the fulness of my heart. I make mention of you always in
my prayers. Forget me not in yours; and fail not to give thanks, as well
as pray, for your affectionate brother and servant, in our common Lord,</p>

<h2><em>FIRST VISIT TO SCOTLAND.</em></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">August to November, 1741.</span></h3>


<p>At the very time when Wesley was founding Methodism
in Bristol and in London, certain charges were brought,
by the Commissioners of the General Assembly of the
Church of Scotland, against the following ministers of that
community: namely, Ebenezer Erskine, of Stirling; William
Wilson, of Perth; Alexander Moncrieff, of Abernethy; James
Fisher, of Kinclaven; Ralph Erskine, of Dunfermline; Thomas
Mair, of Orwell; Thomas Nairn, of Abbots-hall; and James
Thompson, of Burntisland.</p>

<p>Ebenezer Erskine was ordained, at Portmoak, in 1703;
and Ralph, at Dunfermline, in 1711. The former was
now sixty-one years of age, and the latter fifty-six. Both
the brothers had been educated in the University of
Edinburgh; were men of talent; were diligent in the
discharge of their parochial duties; and were eminently
successful in their ministry. For instance, Ralph writes:
"Sabbath, July 10, 1737. I preached at half-past seven in
the morning. The" (sacramental) "tables began to be served
a little before nine, and continued till about twelve at night,
there being between four and five thousand communicants."</p>

<p>The Erskines, however, were not only successful preachers
and pastors, but were reformers. When they disliked a
thing, they said so. They refused to take the oath of
abjuration, not because they were Jacobites, or disloyal to
the House of Hanover; but because the oath seemed to
imply an approval of Episcopacy, and because its avowed
design was the security of the Church of England.</p>

<p>In other ways, they also made themselves singular. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
dominant party in the Church of Scotland were, if not
hostile, yet indifferent, to the most important doctrines of
religion. To correct prevailing and tolerated heresies, an
old book was re-published, entitled "The Marrow of
Modern Divinity," and consisting chiefly of extracts from
Luther and other eminent Protestant divines. The dignitaries
of the Kirk condemned the book. The Erskines
heartily approved of it. A fierce controversy arose out of this.</p>

<p>Again: in 1712, Parliament revived the law respecting
patronage in the Church of Scotland. This led to great
excitement, and great wrongs. At the General Assembly
in 1730, there were twelve cases of appeal against
the intrusion of obnoxious ministers. The Assembly not
only dismissed the appeals, but enacted that, henceforth,
no reasons of dissent "against the determination of Church
judicatories" should be entered on the record. Angry discussions
followed. Ebenezer Erskine, in 1732, laid before
the Assembly a "representation of grievances," signed by
himself and others, and spoke accordingly. In the same
year, as moderator of the Synod of Perth and Stirling,
he opened the Synod, by preaching a sermon, in the
course of which he remonstrated against the act of the preceding
Assembly with regard to the settlement of ministers,
alleging that it was contrary to the word of God, and the
established constitution of the Church. For this, the Synod
passed upon him a vote of censure. Erskine appealed to
the General Assembly; but the censure of the Synod was
confirmed, and Erskine was appointed to be rebuked and
admonished at the bar of the Assembly. He refused to
submit to this. His brother Ralph and the other ministers,
already mentioned, sympathised with him. Further agitation
followed, and the result of the whole was, the following
charges were preferred against them:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That they had seceded from the Church of Scotland
by a total withdrawing from attendance upon, and submission
to, its judicatories. 2. That they had formed them
selves into a Presbytery, and had exercised judicial presbyterial
power, not only over their own congregations, but also
over the whole church. 3. That they had published a
printed paper, not only assigning the grounds of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
irregular conduct, but condemning the Church and the
judicatories thereof. 4. That they had administered the
sacraments to persons of other congregations, without the
knowledge or consent of the ministers who had the pastoral
oversight of such persons. 5. That they had ordained
elders, and had appointed and kept fasts in different parts
of the country, to the neglect of their own proper ministerial
work. 6. That they had licensed one or more persons to
preach. 7. That they had, "in a pretended judicial manner,"
annulled "the sentence of the lesser excommunication," pronounced,
by the presbytery of Dumblain, upon Archibald
Edmund, and had baptized the said Archibald's child.
8. That they had taken upon them to excommunicate
David Lesley, in the parish of the West Kirk, near
Edinburgh. 9. That they had preached, and had baptized
several children, in the parish of West Kirk, without proper
certificates from the ministers of the said parish, etc., etc.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>Such, in substance, were the accusations which the two
Erskines and their friends were summoned to answer, in the
presence of the General Assembly, on the 10th of May,
1739. The accusations were disregarded, and the recusant
ministers were expelled. Up to this period, the whole of
the inhabitants of Scotland, with the exception of a few
Popish, Episcopalian, and Cameronian Dissenters, belonged
to the Established Church of the country. Now was instituted
a new sect, "The Associate Presbytery," or "United
Secession Church."<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>That the Church of Scotland, as well as the Church of
England, needed a reformation, is a fact which cannot admit
of doubt. Abundant evidence might be adduced in proof
of this. The following selections must serve as specimens.</p>

<p>On December 3, 1736, the Erskines and their associates
drew up an "Act, Declaration, and Testimony, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
Doctrine, Worship, Government, and Discipline of the
Church of Scotland," in which it was alleged:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1. No due care has been taken in <em>licensing</em> young men as <em>probationers</em>
for the holy ministry. Many have been licensed, who, by their general
and loose harangues in the pulpit, discover their ignorance of Christ and
Him crucified, and their estrangement from the power of godliness. There
is as little of Christ to be found in their sermons as in the systems of
heathen morals.</p>

<p>"2. The acceptance of presentations has become fashionable; and the
judicatories of the Church, instead of checking this corrupt practice, have
so far encouraged it, that the settlement of <em>presentees</em> has been appointed,
when almost the whole parish was <em>dissenting</em> and <em>reclaiming</em>.</p>

<p>"3. The <em>conduct</em> of the General Assemblies of the Church has not been
<em>equal</em> and <em>impartial</em> in matters of doctrine.</p>

<p>"4. Several <em>arbitrary acts</em> and <em>decisions</em> have been framed and passed
by the General Assemblies of the Church, whereby the government of
the house of God has been undermined, and the discipline sinfully
perverted.</p>

<p>"5. All the above-mentioned steps of defection and apostasy are followed
with many evident signs and causes of the Lord's departure; such
as abounding profanity, impiety, and the vilest immoralities of all sorts,
wherewith the land is greatly polluted. The profane diversions of the
<em>stage</em>, together with night <em>assemblies</em> and <em>balls</em>, these sinful occasions of
wantonness and prodigality, are encouraged and countenanced in the
most considerable cities of the nation. Popish errors and delusions
abound more and more; and the abominable idolatry of the mass is
openly frequented, yet no proper or effectual remedies are applied against
this growing evil. Church discipline is not duly exercised against Papists,
according to former laudable acts and constitutions of this Church. The
<em>penal statutes</em> against <em>witches</em> have, of late, been repealed, contrary to the
express letter of the law of God. The power of religion is daily decaying
through the land; the very form of it is despised by many, and rested
upon by others. Our <em>nobility</em> and <em>barons</em>, who have sometimes displayed
heroic zeal, have generally burst the Lord's bonds asunder, insomuch that
the very form of family worship is either despised or neglected by the
most part of them. Our <em>burgesses</em> and <em>commons</em>, for the most part, know
not the way of the Lord, nor the judgments of their God. The <em>ministers</em>
in the house of God are under a more than ordinary restraint of the Spirit
of God; and he that speaks against the prevailing evils makes himself a
prey."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a dark picture; and the following is not brighter.
It is taken from a sermon, by Ebenezer Erskine, published
in 1736, and entitled, "The Tabernacle of David ruined by
Man, and reared up by the Mighty God."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"God has, in a great measure, departed from high and low, rich and
poor; departed from magistrates, ministers, and people. Little of God
is to be seen in ordinances, or in the judicatories of His Church. Oh
what barrenness under a dispensed gospel! Oh what abounding profanity!
what cursing and swearing! what tyranny and oppression, particularly
in ecclesiastical liberties and privileges! How are intruders
enrolled among the number of the ambassadors of Christ! How are the
privileges of the Lord's people sacrificed, in order to compliment the man
with the <em>gold ring</em> and the <em>gay clothing</em>! The land is groaning under a
weight of sin; and the sin of the land is crying for vengeance from the
hand of God. In many corners of Scotland, an empty jingle of human
oratory, and dry harangues of heathenish morality, are substituted in the
room of the gospel of Christ; a natural kind of religion preached up, and
the supernatural mysteries of the gospel generally exploded, as unfashionable
among many of our young ministers! We have ministers now-a-days,
who, instead of teaching men to deny themselves, do teach them,
from press and pulpit, that self-love is the foundation of moral virtue, and
that carnal reason is the first principle of religion. Although Arian,
Socinian, Arminian, and other detestable and abominable, errors are
rampant, where is there a suitable banner of a testimony united against
them? Higher censures have been inflicted upon men for preaching the
truths of God, than upon others for denying the supreme Deity of the Son
of God. As for formality of worship, look through the most of our
worshipping assemblies in Scotland, and we shall find the carcase of
worship, instead of the soul of it, presented unto the living God. Nothing
but dead ministers, and dead people, dead preaching, hearing, praying,
and praising. The generality of ministers and people sit down with a
form of godliness, while the life and power of it are quite gone."</p></blockquote>

<p>Three more extracts must suffice. The following is selected
from a pamphlet of sixty-three pages, published in 1733,
with the title, "The present State of the Church of Scotland,
with the Duty of the Members thereof enquired into, in a
Sermon, at the opening of the Synod of Perth and Stirling,
October 9, 1733. By Mr. Henry Lindsay, Minister of the
Gospel at Rothkennar."</p>

<p>
"Of late years, Atheism, Infidelity, and Profanity have abounded in<br />
these lands. Many have cast off all fear of God. Our <em>youth of better<br />
fashion</em>, and others who pretend to be wise above their neighbours, have<br />
most shamefully degenerated into the grossest errors. The preaching of<br />
Christ, in His person, offices, and salvation, is become, by too many<br />
among us, as a subject out of date; while our itching ears crave something<br />
that is new, and we are rather pleased to have our imaginations and<br />
fancies tickled by <em>polite phrases</em> and <em>eloquent expressions</em>, than to have<br />
our hearts affected with a sense of sin."<br />
</p>

<p>In 1733, Ebenezer Erskine published a sermon, entitled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
"The Grones of Believers under their Burdens," in which he
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Oh how rampant are atheism and profanity! Impiety, like an impetuous
torrent, carries all before it. It is become fashionable among
some to be impious and profane. Religion is faced down by bold and
petulant wits. Our divisions also are lamentable. Court and country,
church and state, are divided; ministers divided from their people, and
people from their ministers; and both ministers and people divided
among themselves; and every party and faction putting the blame upon
each other. The defections and backslidings of the Church are innumerable.
Public days of fasting and humiliation are rare. How very
few are they whose hearts are bleeding for the abounding wickedness of
the day! Many professors of religion take to themselves a scandalous
latitude in cursing, swearing, lying, drinking, and cheating."</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1744, the Erskines and their party published a pamphlet
of 122 pages, with the title, "Act of the Associate Presbytery,
concerning the Doctrine of Grace." The following is an
extract from it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A flood of errors has broken in upon the land, whereby the Lord's
name is dreadfully dishonoured; the doctrine of justification by grace is
wofully corrupted; the proper imputation of the righteousness of the
Lord Jesus Christ, for our justification before God, is denied; the foundations
of our holy religion are overturned; thousands of precious souls
are destroyed; and wide steps made towards popery and paganism.
There is a dreadful prevalency of Deism; the seed of Arianism is sown;
and there is also a general growth of Arminianism. Profaneness and
wickedness overspread the whole land. All ranks of persons have corrupted
their ways. The Holy Scriptures are burlesqued. Popish errors
and delusions are spreading. The idolatrous mass is openly frequented.
The name of God is profaned by ordinary swearing and by perjury. The
land is also defiled with murders, drunkenness, prodigality, vanity in
apparel, foolish jesting, rioting, wantonness, yea, with open adulteries and
uncleanness of all sorts. Profane and sinful customs are countenanced
and encouraged, both at court, and in some eminent places of the nation&mdash;such
as the diversions of the stage, masquerades, balls, and other
similar seminaries of lewdness and lasciviousness. Likewise fraud and
injustice are to be found amongst us; together with oppressions, lying,
envy, malice, evil-speaking, backbiting, falsehood, and covetousness."</p></blockquote>

<p>This description of the state of things in Scotland is far
from nattering; but it is substantially correct. Scotland,
as well as England, needed a reformation; and it is not
surprising that, when Whitefield heard of the Erskines, he
should sympathise with them. He was the first of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
Methodists who opened a correspondence with the outcast
ministers. Ralph Erskine writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"April 17, 1739. I received a letter this month from Mr. Whitefield,
dated Bristol, March 10, 1739, shewing the great outpouring of the Spirit
in England and Wales, and his utility in bringing home many souls to
Christ; as also his hearing of our success in Scotland, and desiring to
have a line from me. I did not suddenly answer, till I heard more about
him, which I did, both in public prints and by letters from London, having
written for an account of him."<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Erskine was satisfied with what he heard. In his diary,
he repeatedly mentions praying for Whitefield and his
brethren. Friendly letters were exchanged; and a correspondence
continued during the next two years.</p>

<p>As might naturally be expected, the Erskines attracted
the attention of Whitefield and the Wesleys. In some
respects the men were similar; in others they were widely
different. The Erskines were dissatisfied with the state of
the Church of Scotland; and so were Whitefield and the
Wesleys with the state of the Church of England. The
Erskines were expelled from the Church of Scotland, and
yet claimed to be members of it. Whitefield and the
Wesleys, though not expelled from the Church of England,
were practically silenced, for almost all the pulpits of the
Church were closed against them. The Erskines were now
tent-preachers, and preachers in the open-air; so were
Whitefield and his friends. The Erskines, though still
maintaining that they were members of the Church of Scotland,
were openly employed in organising a seceding church.
Whitefield and the Wesleys still called themselves members
of the Church of England; and yet they were actively,
though unintentionally, creating dissenting sects. Scotland
greatly needed protesters like the Erskines; and England
greatly needed open-air preachers like Whitefield and the
Methodists.</p>

<p>A finer field of usefulness than Scotland, or one more
adapted to Whitefield's peculiar genius, doctrines, and mode
of action, it would have been difficult to find. Scotland had
often had meteor-like men, who had startled the country by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
their unexpected advent and proceedings; and Whitefield
was now added to the number. The faith of Scotland,
speaking generally, was, like that of Whitefield, Calvinistic.
Field-preaching&mdash;so offensive to the Church dignitaries of
England&mdash;was no novelty across the Tweed. During the
preceding century, Presbyterians, driven from their churches
by persecuting papists, had transmitted to their descendants
a partiality for religious assemblies in the fields. Everything
seemed to be in Whitefield's favour.</p>

<p>Still, the circumstances just mentioned were not the
reasons why he went to Scotland. As the reader has
already seen, the Erskines and their friends occupied the
same position in Scotland that the Oxford Methodists did
in England. Both parties, without design, had become
national evangelists, and were strangely exciting the churches
of their respective countries.</p>

<p>The correspondence, begun in 1739, was continued. A
month after Whitefield's return to England in 1741, Ralph
Erskine wrote to him as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Dunfermline</span>, <em>April 10, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and very dear Brother</span>,&mdash;Glory to God! who has
enlightened you so clearly, and enabled you to give testimony so faithfully,
against the dangerous errors that are springing up. Blessed be God!
that you are set for the defence of the gospel, and that I hear your song
of distinguishing grace, and of our Lord's powerful presence with you.
Go on, dear brother, in asserting and publishing the doctrine of sovereign
grace, reigning through His righteousness to eternal life; for this, and
only this gospel will be the organ of omnipotency, and the power of God
to the salvation of sinners. We and our people have all a notion of you
as being in the way of reformation. I am persuaded that your coming to
us would be matter of great joy. How great is our need of such awakening
gales of heaven, as you speak of in the last visit you made to Georgia.</p>

<p>"Come, if possible, dear Whitefield, come. There is no face on earth
I would desire more earnestly to see. Yet, I would desire it <em>only</em> in a way
that, I think, would tend most to the advancing of our Lord's kingdom,
and the reformation work, among <em>our</em> hands. Such is the situation of
affairs among us, that, unless you come with a design to meet and abide
with us of 'The Associate Presbytery,' and if you make your public appearances
in the places especially of their concern, I would <em>dread</em> the consequence
of your coming, lest it should seem equally to countenance our
persecutors. Your fame would occasion a flocking to you, to whatever
side you turn; and, if it should be in their pulpits, as no doubt some of
them would urge, we know how it would be improven against us. I know
not with whom you could <em>safely</em> join yourself, if not with us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Wilson, in Perth, who teacheth as our Professor of Divinity, has
more candidates for the ministry under his charge than most of the public
colleges, except Edinburgh. I have two sons with him, who seem to be
promising youths.</p>

<p>"You are still dearer and dearer to me. By your last Journal, I observed
your growing zeal for the doctrine of grace.</p>

<p>"I am, reverend and dear brother, yours in Him, who is the best centre
of our love and union&mdash;<em>the Lord our righteousness</em>,</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield's reply to this strange proposal, to join "The
Associate Presbytery," will be found in the following letters
to Ebenezer Erskine and his brother Ralph:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Bristol</span>, <em>May 16, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I owe you much love. Only want of
time prevents my writing to you oftener.</p>

<p>"This morning I received a kind letter from your brother Ralph, who
thinks it best for me wholly to join 'The Associate Presbytery,' if it should
please God to send me into Scotland. This I cannot altogether agree
to. I come only as an occasional preacher, to preach the simple
gospel, to all who are willing to hear me, of whatever denomination. It
will be wrong in me to join in a reformation, as to church government,
any further than I have light given me from above. If I am quite neuter
as to that in my preaching, I cannot see how it can hinder or retard any
design <em>you</em> may have on foot. My business seems to be to evangelise,&mdash;to
be a Presbyter at large.</p>

<p>"When I shall be sent into your parts, I know not. I write this, that
there may not be the least misunderstanding between us. I love and
honour 'The Associate Presbytery.' With this I send them my due
respects, and most humbly beg their prayers. But let them not be offended,
if, in all things, I cannot immediately fall in with them. Let them leave
me to God. Whatever light He is pleased to give me, I hope I shall be
faithful to it.</p>

<p>"I love you tenderly, but am almost ashamed to subscribe myself your
brother in the best of bonds,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>To Ralph Erskine, Whitefield wrote, on the same subject,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>June 4, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have not yet determined the exact
time of coming to Scotland; but, I believe, I shall be with you in about
three months. I cannot but think that 'The Associate Presbytery' are
a little too hard upon me. If I am neuter as to the particular reformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
of church government till I have further light, it will be enough. I come
simply to preach the gospel, and to be received only as an occasional
itinerant preacher by all, and not to enter into any particular connection
whatever. The Lord, I hope, will order my goings in His ways.</p>

<p>"I have need of your prayers. My trials are great, my comforts far
greater. We are likely to have settled Societies in several places.</p>

<p>"I am, reverend and dear sir, your unworthy fellow-labourer and
affectionate brother and servant in Christ,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>In reply to Whitefield's letter of May 16, the Rev.
Ebenezer Erskine wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Hilldown, near Dunbar</span>, <em>June, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and very dear Brother</span>&mdash;As our Assembly did last
year eject us from our churches, and exclude us from our ministry and
legal maintenance, for lifting up our reformation testimony; so, from all
I can hear, they have, in May last, appointed several violent intrusions to
be made upon Christian congregations; whereby the flock of Christ is
scattered more and more upon the mountains. The wandering sheep
come with their bleatings to 'The Associate Presbytery;' whereby our
work is daily increasing, in feeding and rallying our Master's flock, scattered
and offended by the Established Church.</p>

<p>"From this, you will easily see what reason 'The Associate Presbytery'
have to say, 'Come over to Scotland, and help us!' We hear that God
is with you of a truth; and, therefore, we wish for as intimate a connection
with you as possible, for building the fallen tabernacle of David in Britain,
and particularly in Scotland when you shall be sent to us.</p>

<p>"This, dear brother, and no party views, is at the bottom of any proposal
made by my brother Ralph, in his own name, and in the name of
his Associate Brethren. It would be very unreasonable to propose or
urge that you should incorporate as a member of our Presbytery, and
wholly embark in every branch of our reformation, unless the Father of
lights were clearing your way thereunto. All intended by us, at present,
is, that, when you come to Scotland, your way may be such as not to
strengthen the hands of our corrupt clergy and judicatories, who are
carrying on a course of defection, and worrying out a faithful ministry
from the land.</p>

<p>"Far be it from us to limit your great Master's commission to preach
the gospel to every creature. We ourselves preach the gospel to all,
promiscuously, who are willing to hear us; but we preach not upon the
call and invitation of the ministers, but of the people, which, I suppose,
is your own practice now in England. Should this also be your way when
you come to Scotland, it could do 'The Associate Presbytery' no manner
of harm. But if, besides, you could find freedom to company with us, to
preach with us and for us, and to accept our advices in your work, while
in this country, it might contribute much to weaken the enemy's hand,
and to strengthen ours in the work of the Lord, when the strength of the
battle is against us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am truly sorry for the Wesleys&mdash;to see them so far left to themselves.
I have seen your letter to them, and praise the Lord on your
behalf, who enables you to stand up so valiantly for the truth, and with
so much light and energy.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus the matter stood when Whitefield arrived in Scotland
on July 30, 1741. Whatever might be the motives of
the two Erskines, one of them sixty years of age, and the
other fifty-six, it was scarcely a creditable proceeding to
endeavour to inveigle an impulsive young man of six-and-twenty
to join himself to their own seceding party. No
doubt, they thought, that, in their present difficulties, he
might render them important service; for Whitefield was
the most popular preacher that England had; but they
ought to have remembered, that, however harsh the treatment
to which he had been subjected by the Church of
which he was an ordained minister, he had never formally
severed his connection with that Church; and that he had,
again and again, declared his intention to be, at least for
some time to come, an itinerant preacher, ready to labour
in connection with all churches, but unwilling to become the
settled pastor of any one in particular.</p>

<p>Whitefield spent his first night in Scotland with Ralph
Erskine, at Dunfermline; who, the next day, wrote to his
brother Ebenezer as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Dunfermline</span>, <em>July 31, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"Mr. Whitefield came to me yesternight about ten. I had conversation
with him alone this forenoon. I only mention this one thing about his
ordination; he owned he then knew no other way, but said he would not
have it that way again for a thousand worlds. As to his preaching, he
declares he can refuse no call to preach Christ, whoever gives it: were it
a Jesuit priest or a Mahomedan, he would embrace it for testifying against
them. He preached in my meeting-house this afternoon. The Lord is
evidently with him."<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Was Ralph Erskine strictly correct in his statement that
Whitefield said, if he had life to begin again, he would not
be ordained a minister of the Church of England "for a
thousand worlds"? Many will doubt this; others will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
believe it. Let it pass. The reader will welcome Whitefield's
own account of the first two services he held in
Scotland. In a letter to John Cennick, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <em>August 1, 1741</em>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My very dear Brother</span>,&mdash;As the Messrs. Erskine gave me the
first invitation to Scotland, and have been praying for me in the most
public, explicit, I could almost say, extravagant manner, for near two
years past, I was determined to give them the first offer of my poor ministrations.
Accordingly, I went yesterday to Dunfermline, where dear Mr.
Ralph Erskine has got a large seceding meeting-house. He received me
very lovingly. I preached to his and the town's people,&mdash;a very thronged
assembly. After I had done prayer, and had named my text, the rustling
made by opening the Bibles all at once quite surprised me,&mdash;a scene I
never was witness to before. Our conversation after sermon, in the house,
was such as became the gospel of Christ. They entertained me with
various accounts of the 'Seceders'' labours. At one of their late occasions,
a woman was so deeply affected, that she was obliged to stop her mouth
with a handkerchief to keep herself from crying out. They urged a
longer stay, in order to converse more closely, and to set me right about
church government, and the solemn league and covenant. I informed
them, that, I had given notice of preaching in Edinburgh; but, as they
desired it, I would, in a few days, return, and meet 'The Associate
Presbytery,' in Mr. Ralph Erskine's house. This was agreed on.</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Erskine accompanied me, and, this evening, I preached, to
many thousands, in a place called <em>the Orphan House Park</em>. The Lord
was there. Immediately after sermon, a large company, among whom
were some of the nobility, came to salute me. Amidst our conversation,
came in a portly, well-looking Quaker, nephew of Messrs. Erskine, formerly
a Baptist minister in the north of England, who, taking me by the hand,
said, 'Friend George, I am as thou art. I am for bringing all to the life
and power of the ever-living God; and, therefore, if thou wilt not quarrel
with me about my hat, I will not quarrel with thee about thy gown.' In
this respect, I wish all, of every denomination, were thus minded.</p>

<p>"I find God has blessed my work in these parts. I am most cordially
received by many who love the Lord Jesus. I have just been in company
with a nobleman, who, I believe, truly fears God; and also with a lady of
fashion, who discovers a Christian spirit. I already hear of great divisions;
but Jesus knows how to bring order out of confusion.</p>

<p>"Be pleased to read this to all in Wine Street" (Bristol), "and
remember me kindly to all who love the glorious Redeemer.</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>In accordance with the intimation given in this letter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
Whitefield met "The Associate Presbytery," at Dunfermline,
on Wednesday, August 5, 1741. The ministers present were
the Rev. Messrs. Ralph and Ebenezer Erskine, Moncrieff,
Gibb, Thomas and James Mair, and Clarkson. Two elders
were also present, namely, Messrs. James Wardlaw and John
Mowbray.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>Three days after this conference was held, Whitefield
gave the following account of it, to his friend Mr. Noble, of
New York:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <em>August 8, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,&mdash;'The Associate Presbytery' are so confined that
they will not so much as hear me preach, unless I will join with them.
Mr. Ralph Erskine, indeed, did hear me, and went with me into the pulpit
of the Cannongate Church. The people were ready to shout for joy;
but, I believe, it gave offence to his associates.</p>

<p>"I met most of them, according to appointment, on Wednesday last.
A set of grave venerable men! They soon proposed to form themselves
into a presbytery, and were proceeding to choose a moderator. I asked
them for what purpose? They answered, to discourse, and set me right
about the matter of church government, and the Solemn League and
Covenant. I replied, they might save themselves that trouble, for I had
no scruples about it; and that settling church government, and preaching
about the Solemn League and Covenant, was not my plan. I then
told them something of my experience, and how I was led out into my
present way of acting. One, in particular, said he was deeply affected;
and dear Mr. Erskine desired they would have patience with me; for that,
having been born and bred in England, and having never studied the
point, I could not be supposed to be so perfectly acquainted with the
nature of their covenants. One, much warmer than the rest, immediately
replied, 'that no indulgence was to be shewn me; that England had
revolted most with respect to church government; and that I, born and
educated there, could not but be acquainted with the matter now in
debate.' I told him, I had never yet made the Solemn League and
Covenant the object of my study, being busy about matters, as I judged,
of greater importance. Several replied, that every pin of the tabernacle
was precious. I said, that, in every building, there were outside and
inside workmen; that the latter, at present, was my province; that if
they thought themselves called to the former, they might proceed in their
own way, and I should proceed in mine. I then asked them seriously,
what they would have me to do? The answer was, that I was not desired to
subscribe immediately to the Solemn League and Covenant, but to preach
only for them till I had further light. I asked, why only for them? Mr.
Ralph Erskine said, 'they were the Lord's people.' I then asked, whether
there were no other Lord's people but themselves; and, supposing all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
others were the devil's people, they certainly had more need to be preached
to; and, therefore, I was more and more determined to go out into the
highways and hedges; and that, if the Pope himself would lend me his
pulpit, I would gladly proclaim the righteousness of Jesus Christ therein.
Soon after this, the company broke up; and one of these, otherwise
venerable men, immediately went into the meeting-house, and preached
upon these words, 'Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of
the night? The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the
night; if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.' I attended; but
the good man so spent himself in the former part of his sermon, in talking
against prelacy, the Common Prayer Book, the surplice, the rose in the
hat, and such-like externals, that when he came to the latter part of his
text, to invite poor sinners to Jesus Christ, his breath was so gone, that he
could scarce be heard. What a pity that the last was not first, and the
first last!</p>

<p>"The consequence of all this was an open breach. I retired; I wept;
I prayed; and, after preaching in the fields, sat down and dined with
them, and then took a final leave. At table, a gentlewoman said, she had
heard that I had told some people that, 'The Associate Presbytery' were
building a Babel. I said, 'Madam, it is quite true; and I believe the
Babel will soon fall down about their ears.' But enough of this. Lord,
what is man? what the best of men? but men at the best! I think I
have now seen an end of all perfection. Our brethren in America, blessed
be God! have not so learned Christ. Be pleased to inform them of
this letter.</p>

<p class="sig">
"Ever yours in our common Lord,<br />

"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The only fact, that can be added to this simple statement,
is found in the following extract from a manuscript written
by Ebenezer Erskine:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As Mr. Whitefield shewed an inclination to proceed to a conference
about toleration, it was proposed, that, seeing toleration of all sects is an
opinion of his, it was thought fit to consider what is the form of government
Christ has laid down in His word. And, agreeably to this, Mr.
Whitefield put the question, Whether Presbyterian government be that
which is agreeable to the pattern shewn in the mount? and, supposing
that it is, whether it excluded a toleration of such as Independents, Anabaptists,
and Episcopalians, among whom there are good men? Mr.
Ebenezer Erskine said to him, 'Sir, God has made you an instrument of
gathering a great multitude of souls to the faith and professing of the
gospel throughout England, and also in foreign parts; and now it is fit
that you should consider how that body is to be organised and preserved;
which cannot be done without following the example of Paul and Barnabas,
who, when they had gathered churches by the preaching of the gospel,
visited them again, and ordained over them elders in every city; which
you cannot do alone, without some two or three met together, in a judicative
capacity, in the name of the Lord. Unto all which, Mr. Whitefield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
replied, that he reckoned it his present duty to go on preaching the gospel
without proceeding to any such work. It was urged that, after his death,&mdash;the
flock might be scattered, and fall into the hands of grievous wolves,
without any to care for them. He said, that he, being of the communion
of the Church of England, had none to join him in that work; and that
he had no freedom to separate from the Church of England, until it
excommunicated him."<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This is all the <em>authentic</em> information that exists respecting
the memorable conference at Dunfermline. It is certainly
amusing, and invites criticism; but the reader must form
his own judgment of the chief actors in this ecclesiastical
assembly. Suffice it to remark here, that, Whitefield's
friends of "The Associate Presbytery" became extremely
wroth; "From that time, they not only disavowed all connection
with him, but preached against him publicly, and
even went so far as to stigmatise him as an agent of the
devil."<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> This is not an unfounded assertion. In 1742, the
Rev. Adam Gibb, one of the members of "The Associate
Presbytery," who met Whitefield at Dunfermline on August
5, 1741, published a closely written pamphlet of seventy-five
pages, with the following title: "A Warning against countenancing
the Ministrations of Mr. George Whitefield, published
in the New Church at Bristow, upon Sabbath, June 6,
1742. Together with an Appendix upon the same subject,
wherein are shewn, that Mr. Whitefield is <em>no</em> Minister of
Jesus Christ; that his <em>call</em> and <em>coming</em> to Scotland are
<em>scandalous</em>; that his practice is <em>disorderly</em>, and <em>fertile</em> of
disorder; that his <em>whole</em> doctrine is, and his success <em>must</em>
be, <em>diabolical</em>; so that people ought to <em>avoid</em> him, from <em>duty</em>
to God, to the Church, to themselves, to their fellow-men,
to posterity, and to <em>him</em>. By Adam Gibb, Minister of the
Gospel at Edinburgh." (12mo.) A few extracts from this
sour pamphlet must be given.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is no unusual thing with Mr. Whitefield, in his Journals, to apply
unto himself things said of and by the Christ of God. In the 'Account
of God's Dealings with Him,' he holds himself out as comparable with
Christ, at his birth in an inn, in his suffering of thirst, and in the
transition from suffering to relief. The general scope of his Journals is to
publish and celebrate himself; the <em>matter</em> thereof being generally such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
is for no man's advantage, nor worth any man's while to know. He goes
through the world preaching as some <em>notable</em> person, or as a general
<em>quickener</em> of ministers and people, while standing <em>co-ordinate</em> with none of
them; and it is well known, that much of his preaching is employed in
publishing his own <em>sin</em>, <em>sufferings</em>, <em>exaltation</em>, <em>achievements</em>, and <em>concern</em>
for the salvation of men."</p>

<p>"As this foreigner" (Whitefield) "comes here without any Scripture
mission or call, so his known and avowed <em>principles</em> are <em>prelatical</em>, and
thus contrary to the word of God. His <em>present</em> ministrations have a
<em>direct</em> tendency to introduce among us a <em>latitudinarian</em> scheme; and
particularly to make men <em>sceptics</em> as to the <em>discipline</em> and <em>government</em> of
the house of God. True, indeed, this is propagated under a very specious
pretence,&mdash;a <em>pretence</em> of <em>universal charity</em> for good men, that differ about
these things. And now matters are come to that pass with many, that it
is reckoned <em>uncivil</em> and <em>uncharitable</em> to make any ado about our <em>Reformation
standards</em> of discipline and government, though founded in the word
of God."</p>

<p>"That Mr. Whitefield is no minister of Christ appears from the <em>manner</em>
wherein that office, he professes to bear, is <em>conveyed</em> to him. He derives
it from a <em>diocesan bishop</em>, who derives his office from the king, and the
king professes not to be a church-officer at all."</p>

<p>"The awful <em>profanation</em> of the Lord's day, which the noise of Mr.
Whitefield's ministrations <em>introduces</em>, deserves especial consideration. It
is well known, that, on this day, multitudes in Edinburgh wait publicly
(and very indecently too) for his appearance, through several hours before
the time appointed for it, and that while public worship is exercised through
the city, where these people profess no scruple to join. The <em>profanity</em> of
this practice needs no proof, and the profanity of <em>countenancing</em> it needs as
little."</p>

<p>"The complex scheme of Mr. Whitefield's doctrine is <em>diabolical</em>, as
proceeding through diabolical <em>influence</em>, and applied unto a diabolical
<em>use</em>, against the Mediator's glory, and the salvation of men. This is the
awful <em>point</em> whereunto the whole articles of our charge against him are
gathered."</p>

<p>"We conclude, that, all Mr. Whitefield's <em>hearers</em> are <em>exposing</em> themselves
to <em>Satanical</em> influence: and, from the preceding reasonings, it follows,
that all who <em>espouse</em> his way, must be either the formal <em>subjects</em> of <em>such
Satanical</em> operation as we have been considering, or be <em>led</em> by Satan
unto <em>blind</em>, <em>unreasonable</em>, and <em>furious contending</em> for that gloomy cause.
Is not this, then, most <em>hellish hurt</em>, which they acquire in countenancing
him?"</p>

<p>"How <em>awful</em> is the condition and progress of this man, while <em>roaming</em>
about far and near, and warmly casting forth floods of doctrine calculated
for transmitting <em>devils</em> into the <em>hearts</em> of men! At the same time, God is
giving up many ministers, and multitudes of people, to run after him, over
the belly of <em>reason</em> and <em>religion</em>; and to publish their embarking with
him, better than ever they did with the <em>Christ</em> of God. Thus is he, in the
judgment of God, become a <em>plague</em> to their <em>heads</em>, <em>hearts</em>, and <em>eyes</em>, rendering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
them <em>blind</em>, <em>infatuated</em>, and <em>furious</em> in a new career of apostasy from
God. They are evidently given up to the lust of <em>Satan</em>, rendering
them either <em>patients</em>, <em>apprentices</em>, or <em>journeymen</em>, with reference to the
<em>drug</em> of <em>Satanical</em> doctrine that is now vended among us."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was the language used, concerning Whitefield, by one
of the very men who, only ten months before, had done their
utmost to induce him to identify himself with their "Associate
Presbytery."<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> And to shew that he was not an exception
among his brethren, it may be added, that, in 1744, "The
Associate Presbytery" itself published a long official document
of 138 pages, in which, after enumerating the sins of
Scotland, they added:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The sins and provocations of this land are further increased by the
kind reception that many, both ministers and people, have given to Mr.
George Whitefield, a professed member and priest of the superstitious
Church of England; and by the great entertainment that has been given
to <em>latitudinarian tenets</em>, as propagated by him and others; whereby any
particular form of church government is denied to be of Divine institution,
and also, whereby, under a pretence of <em>catholic love</em>, a scheme is laid for
uniting parties of all denominations in church communion, in a way destructive
of any testimony for the declarative glory of Immanuel, as Head
and King of Zion, and for the covenanted reformation of this Church and
land."<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To say the least, there was something pitiably mean in this
action of the men who had invited Whitefield to visit Scotland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
Because he declined to join their sect, they became
his calumniating enemies. There can be little doubt that
their bigotry enhanced Whitefield's popularity. He spent
thirteen weeks in Scotland; and his letters, written during
this period, will amply prove what has just been stated. At
the risk of being prolix, somewhat copious extracts must be
given. At least thirty towns had the benefit of his ministrations,
though the first month seems to have been employed
in Edinburgh and its immediate neighbourhood. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <em>August 8, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"On Sunday evening" (last), "I preached in a field near the Orphan
House, to upwards of fifteen thousand people; and on Monday, Friday,
and Saturday evenings, to near as many. On Tuesday, I preached in the
Cannongate Church; on Wednesday and Thursday, at Dunfermline; and,
on Friday morning, at Queen's Ferry. Everywhere the auditories were
large, and very attentive. Great power accompanied the Word. Many
have been brought under convictions."<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To the Rev. Mr. Willison, minister at Dundee, he addressed
the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <em>August 10, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I just now had the pleasure of your
letter, for which be pleased to accept my hearty thanks.</p>

<p>"Glory be to free grace! Many are here brought under convictions.
The glorious Emmanuel is pleased to clothe His word with power. I am
amazed at His loving-kindness, and want heaven and earth to join with
me in praising His holy name.</p>

<p>"I wish you would not trouble yourself or me by writing about the corruptions
of the Church of England. I believe there is no Church perfect
under heaven; but, as God is pleased to send me forth simply to preach
the gospel to all, I think there is no need of casting myself out. The
divisions in Scotland are affecting, and will occasion great searchings of
heart."</p></blockquote>

<p>To the Rev. Mr. Ogilvie, of Aberdeen, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <em>August 10, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I thank you for your kind and obliging
letter. I hope to come into the northern parts; but the precise time I
cannot tell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span></p>

<p>"I find it best simply to preach the pure gospel, and not to meddle at
all with controversy. The present divisions are a sore judgment to Scotland.
This is my comfort, Jesus is king. I have been with several of
'The Associate Presbytery,' but I see no hopes of accommodation. O
that the power of religion may revive! Nothing but that can break down
the partition wall of bigotry."</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the noblemen with whom Whitefield became
acquainted in Edinburgh was Lord Rae, to whom he wrote
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <em>August 11, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;I hope this will find your lordship safe at your journey's
end, rejoicing in God for giving His angels charge concerning you in the
way. The Lord of all lords has dealt most lovingly with me since your
departure hence. His power has been frequently made known in the great
congregation, and many come to me daily, crying out, 'What shall I do
to be saved?' I hope we shall see the kingdom of God come with power.
This is the full desire of my soul. I am determined to seek after and know
nothing else. Besides this, all other things are but dung and dross. O
my Lord, why should we, who are pilgrims, mind earthly things? Why
should we, who are soldiers, entangle ourselves with the things of this
life? Heavenly-mindedness is the very life of a Christian. It is all in
all."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another nobleman, who became one of Whitefield's friends,
was the Marquis of Lothian. The following is an extract
from Whitefield's letter to him:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <em>August 12, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;I am surprised to find your lordship so condescending as
to write to me. How bright does humility shine in great personages! I
pray God to give your lordship grace to determine to know nothing but
Jesus Christ and Him crucified. He is the only centre of true happiness.
In Him alone, solid, lasting joys are to be found. Having Jesus, I find,
in Him I possess all things. But whither am I going? Your lordship
will excuse me. I pray God to visit you with His great salvation. I thank
your lordship for your intended benefaction to the poor Georgia orphans.
I hope the glorious Emmanuel will accept it at your hands."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another letter, apparently to Howell Harris, who probably
was supplying Whitefield's pulpit at the Tabernacle, London,
was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <em>August 13, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My very dear Brother</span>,&mdash;'The Associate Presbytery' have been
hard upon me; but I find no freedom any longer than I continue just as
I am, and evangelize to all. I know not that I differ from you in one
thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span></p>

<p>"Glory be to God for what He has done in London! He is doing great
things here. I walk in the continual sunshine of His countenance. Every
day, fresh seals are given of my ministry. This morning, God opened my
mouth to speak to preachers of the gospel. Be pleased to accept this
summary account of my proceedings. On Sunday morning, I preached to
the orphans here; and in the evening to as many people as the Sunday
before. Every day since, excepting Monday, I have preached, either in
the churches or field, twice a day; and, yesterday, I collected upwards of
£93 for the Georgia orphans. People are daily coming under deep convictions,
and fresh invitations are sent me to preach at divers places round
about. On Sunday, I purpose to preach in the country, and also the greater
part of the following week, and shall return again about Friday to this city.
O my brother, exhort all to praise the Lord!"</p></blockquote>

<p>In a letter to David Erskine, of Stirling, one of the sons
of Ebenezer Erskine, Whitefield seems to attribute the blame
of the bigoted proceedings of the Dunfermline conference
to others than to the two Erskine brothers:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <em>August 13, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,&mdash;The treatment I met with from 'The Associate
Presbytery' was not altogether such as I expected. It grieved me, as much
as it did you. I could scarce refrain from bursting into a flood of tears. I
wish all were like-minded with your honoured father and uncle. Matters
then would not be carried on with so high a hand. Such violent methods,
such a narrow way of acting, can never be the way to promote and enlarge
the kingdom of the blessed Jesus. It surely must be wrong to fix such
bounds to ourselves, as forbid even our hearing those who love the Lord
Jesus in sincerity, and have also been owned of Him. Christ would not
have done so. Supposing the scheme of government, which 'The Associate
Presbytery' contend for, to be scriptural, yet forbearance and long-suffering
ought to be exercised towards such as differ from them. I am persuaded,
there is no such form of government, prescribed in the book of God, as
excludes a toleration of all other forms whatsoever. If the New Testament
outward tabernacle was to be built as punctual as the Old, as punctual
directions would have been given about the building of it; whereas, it is
only deduced by inference, and thus we see Independents, Presbyterians,
and Episcopalians bring the same text to support their particular scheme;
and, I believe, Jesus Christ thereby would teach us to exercise forbearance
to each other. If the scheme of 'The Associate Presbytery' were to take
effect, they must, out of conscience, restrain and grieve, if not persecute,
many of God's children who could not come into their measures; and I
doubt not but their present violent methods, together with the corruptions
of the Assembly, will cause many to turn Independents, and set up particular
churches of their own. This was the effect of Archbishop Laud
acting with so high a hand; and whether it be presbytery or episcopacy,
if managed in the same manner, it will be productive of the same
effects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span></p>

<p>"Blessed be God! I have not so learned Christ. I preach the simple
gospel; and our glorious Jesus is pleased to attend it with His power. O
dear sir, I love and honour your pious father. Remember me in the
kindest manner to the good old man. I pray God, his last days may not
be employed too much in the non-essentials of religion. My heart is knit
to the family. God willing, I am to preach at Falkirk on Tuesday evening,
and purpose to be at Stirling that night, and to preach twice there
the next day. If it was thought advisable, I would collect for the Orphan
House at Georgia in the afternoon."</p></blockquote>

<p>In another letter, dated "Edinburgh, August 15, 1741,"
Whitefield speaks of more than "three hundred in the city
seeking after Jesus," and says: "Every morning I have a
levee of wounded souls. At seven in the morning, we have
a lecture in the fields, attended not only by the common
people, but persons of great rank. I have reason to think
several of the latter sort are coming to Jesus. Little
children also are much wrought upon. Congregations
consist of many thousands. I preach twice daily, and expound
in private houses at night, and am employed in
speaking to souls under distress great part of the day."</p>

<p>On August 24, Whitefield tells James Habersham, his
Orphan-house superintendent, that, he had collected, in
Scotland, nearly £200, and had a prospect of collecting
much more. He had "bought five hundred yards of cloth
for the dear orphans' winter wear;" but was still hundreds
of pounds in debt.</p>

<p>To Ralph Erskine, who had insinuated that Whitefield's
wish to raise money for his orphans had made him a temporizer,
the following was addressed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <em>August 24, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I thank you for your kind letter. I
believe it proceeded from love; but, as yet, I cannot think the Solemn
League and Covenant is obligatory upon me. Indeed, dear sir, you mistake
if you think I temporize on account of the orphans. Be it far from me.
I abhor the very thought of it. I proceed now, just as I have ever done
since I entered the ministry; and, so far from not setting a hedge about
our Lord's garden, if I were called to it, I should set a much closer hedge
than that which 'The Associate Presbytery' are planting. I should
enquire into people's experiences, before I admitted them to the Lord's
table. I should have church members meet in church fellowship, and tell
one another what God has done for their souls. You seem to think I am
not open to light. That I may give you satisfaction, I am willing to confer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
with Mr. Wilson,<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> at Perth, where I am to be on Thursday, September 3.
On Tuesday next, I purpose preaching at Dunfermline. I am engaged to
sup at your colleague's house, but intend to lie at yours."</p></blockquote>

<p>Towards the end of August, Whitefield appears to have
made a preaching tour in the Scottish provinces.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> In a
letter dated "Perth, September 3," 1741, he says: "For nine
days past, I have preached, twice every day, to very large and
affected auditories, in many towns and villages." At Dundee,
"good was done." At Crieff, he had "a most precious meeting."
At Glasgow, he "preached ten times.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> The congregations
were very large, as were the contributions, and many
were brought under the deepest convictions."<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> After his
return to Edinburgh, the following was addressed to a friend
in London:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <em>September 24, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"On Sunday last, I preached here four times, twice in a church, and
twice in the fields; in the evening, I collected £20 for the Royal Infirmary.
On Monday morning, I visited the children in the three hospitals; and
preached, in the evening, in the park. On Tuesday and Wednesday, I
preached at Kinglassie, Aberdour, and Inverkeithing. On Thursday, I
visited the prison; and, in the evening, preached to the children of the
city, with a congregation of near twenty thousand, in the park."</p></blockquote>

<p>To Lord Rae, Whitefield wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Galashiels</span>, <em>September 28, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;I have received your lordship's liberal benefaction for
the orphans, for which, and all other favours, you have my hearty thanks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
The innumerable instances of God's goodness quite melt me down. The
word of God prevails more and more. Everywhere Jesus Christ is
getting Himself the victory in poor sinners' hearts. I trust, your lordship's
daughters will feel the power of Christ's blood. Happy they, who
do feel it. They are sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty. What a
rich person is the poorest Christian! He is joint-heir with Jesus Christ."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another nobleman must be introduced. From the year 1741
to 1753, the Earl of Leven and Melville was His Majesty's
Commissioner in the General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland,&mdash;the head of a family whose history had been
closely connected with Presbyterian struggles and triumphs.
He was a senator of the College of Justice, and one of the
Lords of Police for Scotland. He married Mary, daughter
of Colonel Erskine, of Carnock; and died on the 2nd of
September, 1754.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> The following was addressed to him:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <em>October 2, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;Last night, I returned from the south country, and received
your lordship's kind letter. My invitation to Coupar was in the
name of many: who the persons were that signed the letter, I cannot tell.
I have sent it enclosed in this. Had I known it to be more agreeable to
your lordship, I would have appointed the meeting at Melville; but, I
fear, as public notice has been given, it will now be impracticable. I
cannot possibly stay with your lordship all Tuesday, having to preach at
Dundee; but, in my return from Aberdeen, I hope to be at your lordship's
house. I am glad you intend to be at Kinglassie. I shall have both
sermons early; and hope the glorious Jesus will be with us in going to
Melville.</p>

<p>"O, my lord, I want a thousand tongues to shew forth the Redeemer's
praise. Having Him, though I have nothing else, I find I possess all
things. I have not forgotten your lordship since I wrote last. You are
and will be much upon my heart. I have heard of the piety of your
lordship's ancestors. Take courage, my lord, and fear not to follow a
crucified Jesus without the camp, bearing His reproach. Beware of
honour, falsely so called. Dare to be singularly good; and be not
ashamed of Jesus or His gospel. Look to Christ by faith, and your
lordship's great possessions will not retard, but promote, your progress in
the divine life. What sweet communion will you then enjoy with God, in
your walks and gardens! They will then be a little paradise to your soul."</p></blockquote>

<p>Wherever he was, Whitefield never forgot his orphans in
Georgia. His establishment there was now large and prosperous.
The buildings were completed. The summer crops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
had been plentiful. The family consisted of eighty-four
persons, men, women, and children. Nineteen others were
employed in cultivating the estate. They had upwards of a
hundred head of cattle; and, during the year, had "planted
upwards of twenty acres, and had cleared twenty acres more,
to enjoy the conveniency of the air." "We live," wrote Mr.
Habersham, "entirely within ourselves, except a few necessaries
which we cannot do without, and are obliged to purchase
elsewhere. Twice a day, we eat <em>hominy</em><a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> of our own
raising, and, at present, without molasses. For dinner, we
eat beef of our own stock, and peas for bread, of all which
we have plenty, and shall have for three months to come.
Our garden is very fruitful of greens, turnips, etc., and we
expect a good crop of potatoes. In short, we have a
sufficiency of wholesome food. Glory be to God! we daily
see our heavenly Father's hand supplying us in this wilderness
land; but I must have cash, not only to pay debts, but
also to buy clothing and many other necessaries."<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>While the honoured guest of the Earl of Leven and
Melville, Whitefield sent the following letter to his faithful
superintendent in Georgia:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Melville</span>, <em>October 5, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My very dear Friend and Brother</span>,&mdash;I have, by the ship which
brings you this, sent you £70 worth of different sorts of goods, to be
disposed of, and the money to be applied to the use of the Orphan House.
I have also sent six hundred yards of cloth, a present of my own, to make
the boys and girls coats and gowns, some whereof I have had made up
here. The other things were given by various persons. Amongst these,
you will find some damask tablecloths, which I desire you will sell, they
being too good, in my opinion, for our use. I have been enabled to pay
my brother, and also Mr. N&mdash;&mdash;'s bill of £300.<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> There is yet £200 to be
paid; but very shortly, I hope to discharge that also.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"I have been in Scotland about two months; and God has been pleased
to bless my ministrations in an abundant manner. The good that has
been done is inexpressible. I am intimate with three noblemen, and
several ladies of quality, who have a great liking for the things of God.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> I

thoughts of visiting Ireland. Whether I shall do that, or come to America,

family. Thousands of prayers are put up for us, and thousands of lies
are spread abroad against us."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of "the thousands of lies," the following, extracted from
a letter written not long after Whitefield's visit, may be
taken as a specimen:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Wherever he went, he had a gaping crowd around him, and had the
address to make them part with their money. He was a pickpocket, and
inflexible about the article of gathering money. He went off to England
with a full purse, but with a ruined reputation among all except his bigoted
admirers. Very few ministers enter into the spirit of Whitefieldism."<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span></p>


<p>Whitefield refers to the same sort of calumny in the
following, which was to a friend in Edinburgh:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Melville</span>, <em>October 5, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"The calumnies of evil men are not to be regarded. I value them not
in the least. My largest donations have been from the rich. The mites,
which the lower sort of people have given, I am persuaded will not prevent
their paying their debts, and will not impoverish their families. Mr.
W&mdash;&mdash; wishes there may be a contribution for myself; but I will not
admit of any such thing. I make no purse. What I have, I give away.
Freely I have received; freely I desire to give. 'Poor, yet making many
rich,' shall be my motto still. My great and professed design is to bring
poor sinners to Jesus Christ; but, as my orphan family is now large, and
has daily to be provided for, without the least visible fund; and as I
believe much glory will redound to God from the Orphan House, I think
it my duty to speak to those who, for Christ's sake, are willing to afford
help. I would have no one afraid of doing too much good, or think that
a little given in charity will impoverish the country."</p></blockquote>

<p>From Melville, Whitefield proceeded to Aberdeen, where
he spent several days; and here a strange scene occurred.
The two ministers of the Kirk were the Rev. Mr. Bisset
and the Rev. Mr. Ogilvie, with the latter of whom Whitefield
had been in correspondence. In a long letter, Whitefield
writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Aberdeen</span>, <em>October 9, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"At my first coming here, things looked a little gloomy; for the magistrates
had been so prejudiced by one Mr. Bisset, that, when applied to,
they refused me the use of the kirkyard to preach in. This Mr. Bisset
is colleague with one Mr. Ogilvie, at whose repeated invitation I came
hither. Though colleagues of the same congregation, they are very
different in their natural tempers. The one is, what they call in Scotland,
of a <em>sweet-blooded</em>; the other, of a choleric disposition. Mr. Bisset is
neither a Seceder, nor quite a Kirkman, having great fault to find with
both. Soon after my arrival, dear Mr. Ogilvie took me to pay my respects
to him: he was prepared for this, and immediately pulled out a paper,
containing a great number of insignificant queries, which I had neither
time nor inclination to answer. The next morning, it being Mr. Ogilvie's
turn, I lectured and preached. The magistrates were present; the congregation
was very large; and light and life fled all around. In the
afternoon, Mr. Bisset officiated; and I attended. He began his prayers
as usual; but, in the midst of them, naming me by name, he entreated
the Lord to forgive the dishonour that had been put upon him, by my being
suffered to preach in that pulpit; and, that all might know what reason
he had to put up such a petition, he, in about the middle of his sermon,
not only urged that I was a curate of the Church of <em>England</em>, but also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
quoted a passage or two from my printed sermons, which, he said, were
grossly <em>Arminian</em>. Most of the congregation seemed surprised and
chagrined, and especially his good-natured colleague, Mr. Ogilvie, who
immediately after sermon, without consulting me, stood up and gave
notice that Mr. Whitefield would preach in about half an hour. The
interval being so short, the magistrates returned into the sessions-house;
and the congregation patiently waited, big with expectation of hearing
my resentment. At the time appointed, I went up, and took no other
notice of the good man's ill-timed zeal, than to observe, in some part of
my discourse, that, if the good old gentleman had seen some of my later
writings, wherein I had corrected several of my former mistakes, he would
not have expressed himself in such strong terms. The people, being thus
diverted from controversy with man, were deeply impressed with what
they heard from the word of God. All were hushed, and more than
solemn; and, on the morrow, the magistrates sent for me, and begged I
would accept of the freedom of the city."<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>For the present, poor Mr. Bisset was vanquished. Besides
expounding in private houses, Whitefield added five more
sermons to the two already preached; many of his hearers
"were brought under great convictions; and the people
much regretted his departure."<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p>Leaving Aberdeen on Wednesday, October 13, Whitefield
began his journey back to Edinburgh. On October 14, he
preached at Stonhithe and Benham; on the 15th, thrice at
Montrose; on the 16th and 17th, five times at Brechin;
on the 18th, twice at Forfar; on the 19th, twice at Coupar,
near the residence of Earl Leven, whose guest he was; and
on the 20th and 21st, four times at Dundee, where, he says,
"the concern among the hearers was very remarkable." A
week after this, he set out for Wales, but, before he went, he
preached and lectured, in Edinburgh, in three days, not fewer
than sixteen times. Hence the following to John Cennick,
his curate at the Tabernacle, London:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <em>October 27, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My very dear Brother</span>,&mdash;Although it be past eleven at night, I
cannot miss a post. The Lord is doing great things here. On Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
last (October 24), the Lord enabled me to preach four times, and to
lecture, in the evening, in a private house. Yesterday, I preached three
times, and lectured at night. To-day, Jesus has enabled me to preach
seven times; once in the Church, twice at the Girls' Hospital, once in the
Park, once at the Old People's Hospital, and afterwards twice in a private
house. Notwithstanding, I am now as fresh as when I arose in the
morning. Both in the church and park, the Lord was with us. The
girls in the hospital were exceedingly affected, and so were the standers
by. One of the mistresses told me, that she is now awakened in the
morning by the voice of prayer and praise; and the master of the boys
says, that they meet together every night to sing and pray, and that, when
he goes to their rooms, to see if all be safe, he generally disturbs them at
their devotions. The presence of God, at the Old People's Hospital, was
wonderful. The Holy Spirit seemed to come down like a mighty rushing
wind. Every day, I hear of some fresh good wrought by the power of
God. I scarce know how to leave Scotland. I believe I shall think it
my duty to pay the inhabitants another visit as soon as possible. Above
£500 have been collected, in money and goods, for the poor orphans.
To-morrow, I shall leave this place, and go through Wales in my way to
London."</p></blockquote>

<p>Before he left Edinburgh, Whitefield wrote another letter
to Earl Leven, which, considering the high office held by
that nobleman in the General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland, was somewhat singular, but, at the same time,
bravely faithful. His lordship had given Whitefield a horse,
for his long journey through Wales to London.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <em>October 26, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;It is now past eleven at night. All is wrapt in awful
silence. My soul is in a quiet, composed frame. I have been giving
your lordship's letter a second reading. The Holy Spirit seems to be
moving upon your soul; and I trust you will now awake into a new world,
and know what it is to live by faith. O that the stone of infidelity, which
before lay at the door of your heart, may now be rolled away! O that
you may rise, be loosed from your corruptions, and go about doing good!
My lord, if you could be brought to love secret prayer, and to converse
feelingly with God in His word, your heaven would begin on earth: you
would enjoy more pleasure than in all manner of riches. What will those
avail, if you are not rich towards God? As for praying in your family, I
entreat you not to neglect it. You are bound to do it. Apply to Christ
for strength to overcome your present fears. They are the effects of pride,
or infidelity, or of both. After once or twice, the difficulty will be over.</p>

<p>"It rejoices me to think that I shall one day, perhaps, see a church in
Melville House. Happy, happy are you, my lord, in having such a
consort, who will forward you in every good word and work. As God
shall enable me, I shall bear you both upon my heart. My riding upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
your lordship's horse will often remind me to pray for the donor. I should
be glad to hear, from time to time, what the Lord is doing for your soul.
Since you have laid your commands upon me, I shall write as often as
possible.</p>

<p>"It is late; the clock has struck twelve. Methinks, I could wish the
cry was now made, 'Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!' My soul longs to
go forth to meet Him. This evening, I was greatly refreshed in preaching
on these words, 'This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of
Jerusalem.' When shall I see Him as He is? Well may your lordship say,
'He is altogether lovely.' Eternity is too short to utter all His praise."</p></blockquote>

<p>The reader has now the substance of Whitefield's own account
of his first tour in Scotland. Many anecdotes in relation
to it still exist, and the following may be taken as specimens.</p>

<p>When preaching at Dunfermline, it was known that
Whitefield would make a collection for his Orphan House
in Georgia. A gentleman, of some importance in the town,
determined he would not be persuaded by the great orator
to be a contributor, and, before leaving home, emptied
his pockets of all his money. Whitefield, in the course of
his sermon, mentioned the excuses often made for not
practising beneficence, and, among others, dwelt upon the
case of those who designedly came to religious services
without their cash. The prudent gentleman at once borrowed
of a friend half a guinea for the collector.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>Whitefield's power of riveting the attention of his auditors
was marvellous. It is related, by one of his biographers,
that a gentleman, who had been to hear him in the Orphan
House Park, Edinburgh, was met, on his way home, by an
eminent minister, under whom he usually sat. The minister,
indignant at the aberration of this distinguished member
of his flock, expressed his surprise that he should have
gone to hear such a rambling preacher as Whitefield was.
"Sir," replied the admonished gentleman, "when I hear
you, I am planting trees all the time; but during the
whole of Mr. Whitefield's sermon, I had no time for
planting even one."<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<p>In one of his journeys, Whitefield was told of a widow
with a large family, whose landlord had distrained her furniture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
and was about to sell it, unless her rent was paid.
Whitefield's purse was never large, but his sympathy was
great, and he, immediately, gave the five guineas which the
helpless woman needed. The friend, who was travelling
with him hinted, that the sum was more than he
could reasonably afford; to which the gushing, if not perfectly
accurate, reply was, "When God brings a case of
distress before us, it is that we may relieve it." The two
travellers proceeded on their journey, and, before long,
encountered a highwayman, who demanded their money,
which they gave. Whitefield now turned the tables on his
friend, and reminded him how much better it was for the
poor widow to have the five guineas than the thief, who had
just robbed them. They had not long resumed their travel,
before the man returned, and demanded Whitefield's coat,
which was much more respectable than his own. This
request was also granted, Whitefield accepting the robber's
ragged habiliment till he could procure a better. Presently,
they perceived the marauder again galloping towards them
most furiously; and now, fearing that their lives were
threatened, they also spurred their horses, and, fortunately,
arrived at some cottages, before the highwayman could stop
them. The thief was baulked, and, no doubt, was immensely
mortified; for, when Whitefield took off the man's tattered
coat, he found, in one of its pockets, a carefully wrapped
parcel containing one hundred guineas.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>

<p>But enough of floating anecdotes, which may, or may not
be true.</p>

<p>It must be owned that Whitefield rendered but little
service to "The Associate Presbytery," at whose invitation
he went to Scotland; but that was the fault, not of Whitefield,
but, of the members of the Presbytery themselves. His
labours were almost entirely those of an evangelist preaching
in the fields, or of a brother minister, belonging to another
church, courteously admitted to the pulpits of the established
Kirk of Scotland. His services, however, were none the
less successful because not confined to the Seceders. There
cannot be a doubt, that, as the labours of the Wesleys and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
of Whitefield were the means of quickening the religious life
of the Church of England, so the labours of Whitefield were,
to a great extent, the means of arousing the dormant
energies of the sister Church of Scotland. Whitefield, as
well as Knox, deserves a monument on the Calton Hill.
Some evidence of this has been already furnished, and
much more will be found in succeeding pages. Whitefield's
own account of his first visit to Scotland may seem extravagant,
and scarcely deserving of implicit credence. To
silence such suspicion, the following extracts from letters
written at the time, will be as useful as they are welcome.</p>

<p>A week after Whitefield's departure, a friend wrote to
him as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <em>November 5, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"In the Tolbooth Church," (where the Rev. Alexander Webster was
minister,) "there has been at sacrament a hundred more than usual,
whereof about thirty young ones had never been admitted before, and of
these, eighteen were converted by your ministry."<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A fortnight later, another friend in Edinburgh said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The seed sown by your ministry daily appears, and in new instances.
I am told the first night a play was acted here this season there were but
about six ladies at it; the second, two; and the third and last, none at all.
The little children of this city cannot forget you. Their very hearts leap
within them upon hearing your name."<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In another letter, from a friend in Scotland, dated,
"December 12, 1741," it is stated, that, Whitefield spent
five days in Glasgow, and preached ten times in the High
Church yard, to vast multitudes reckoned at from ten to
fifteen thousand. Above sixty persons were converted by
his preaching.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>Six months after Whitefield's departure, a minister in
Edinburgh wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Since you left Scotland, numbers, in different places, have been
awakened. Religion, in this sinful city, revives and flourishes. Ordinances
are more punctually attended. People hear the word with gladness,
and receive it in faith and love. New meetings, for prayer and
spiritual conference, are being begun everywhere. Religious conversation
has banished slander and calumny from several tea-tables. Praise is perfected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
out of the mouths of babes and sucklings. Some stout-hearted
sinners are captivated to the obedience of Christ."<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In reference to the same city, Edinburgh, the Rev. Dr.
Muir wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"More than twenty praying societies have been established in this
place. Amongst them are several meetings of boys and girls. There
are also several meetings of young women. There are numbers of young
men, who meet for the purpose of glorifying God, and promoting Christian
knowledge. A good number of old men, substantial, standing
Christians, meet for edification and instruction, and are thereby often
revived and very much refreshed. Upon the whole, we hope, there is
such a flame kindled as shall never be extinguished. This is not all: for
several country people are beginning to assemble together in little meetings,
to worship God; particularly about two miles from this place, where
several ploughmen and other illiterate persons meet for the most noble
purposes, and greatly increase in numbers, grace, and knowledge. About
Old Cambus, six miles from Dunbar, many are meeting together for social
prayer and mutual conversation respecting matters of religion. There
are several other societies for prayer prospering very well."<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Another minister, the Rev. Mr. McCulloch, informed
Whitefield, that fifty persons had been converted by his ten
sermons in Glasgow; and that many others had been convinced
of sin, and were seeking salvation.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> The Rev. Mr.
Ogilvie, at Aberdeen, stated, that Whitefield had been the
means of reviving, in that city, "a just sense and concern
for the great things of religion. I often think," says the
writer, "that the Lord sent him here, to teach me how to
preach, and especially how to suffer. His attachment to no
party, but to Christ, appears to me a peculiar excellency in
him. While he stayed among us, he answered our expectations
so much, that he has scarce more friends anywhere
than here, where, at first, almost all were against him. The
word came with so much power, that, I hope, several of
different denominations will bless the Lord for ever, that
they ever heard him."<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Willison, of Dundee, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Whitefield is hated, and spoken against by all the episcopal
party and even the most of our clergy labour to diminish and expose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
him. But I look upon this youth, as raised up by God for special service,
for promoting true Christianity in the world, and for reviving it where it
is decayed. I see the man to be all of a piece; his life and conversation
to be a transcript of his sermons. He is singularly fitted to do the
work of an evangelist; and I have been long of opinion, that, it would be
for the advantage of the world, were this still to be a standing office in
the Church. I have myself been witness to the Holy Ghost falling upon
him and his hearers oftener than once; not in a miraculous, though in an
observable manner. Many here are blessing God, for sending him to
this country, though Satan has raged so much against it. Though he is
ordained a minister of the Church of England, he has always conformed
to us, both in doctrine and worship, and lies open to conform to us in
other points. God, by owning him so wonderfully, is pleased to give a
rebuke to our intemperate bigotry and party zeal, and to tell us, that
neither circumcision nor uncircumcision availeth anything, but the new
creature."<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>One more contemporaneous testimony must suffice. A
gentleman, "eminent for learning and knowledge of the
world," remarked:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. Whitefield's soundness in the faith, his fervent zeal, and unwearied
diligence in promoting the cause of Christ; the plainness and
simplicity, the affection and warmth of his sermons, and the amazing
power that accompanied them; together with his meekness, humility, and
candid and catholic spirit, convinced the people that there was reason to
think well of him. Conversions were become rare in Scotland; little
liveliness was to be found even in real Christians; and bigotry and blind
zeal were producing animosities and divisions, and turning away the
attention of good men from matters of infinitely greater importance. The
episcopal clergy gave him no countenance, though a few of their people
did. In the Established Church of Scotland, some of the more rigid
Presbyterians would not hold communion with him, on account of his
connection with the Church of England, and because he assumed the
office of an evangelist, peculiar, in their apprehension, to the first ages of
the Church. Some were mightily dissatisfied with him for preaching the
Calvinistic doctrines of election, original sin, efficacious grace, justification
through faith, and the perseverance of the saints; and others,
because he inveighed against the playhouse, dancing assemblies, games
of chance, haunting taverns, vanity and extravagance in dress, and levity
in behaviour and conversation. But, upon many in Edinburgh, of all
ranks and ages, especially young people, deep impressions were made;
and many of them waited on him privately, lamenting their former
immoral lives, or stupid thoughtlessness about religion, and expressing
their anxious concern about obtaining an interest in Christ, and the
sanctifying influences of the Spirit."<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p></blockquote>

<h2><em>SEVEN MONTHS IN ENGLAND.</em></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">November 1741 to June 1742.</span></h3>


<p>Whitefield left Edinburgh on October 29, 1741,
and rode on Earl Leven's horse, three hundred miles,
to Abergavenny in Wales, for the purpose of marrying Mrs.
James, a widow lady, who, up to this period of his history,
is never even mentioned in any of Whitefield's letters. The
marriage ceremony was performed at St. Martin's Chapel,
near Caerphilly, in the parish of Eglws Ilan. The following
is a copy of the register, in the handwriting of the Rev.
John Smith, the then vicar of Eglws Ilan:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
GEORGE WHITEFIELD<br />
<small>AND</small><br />
ELIZABETH JAMES,<br />
<em>Married, November 14, 1741</em>.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a><br />
</p>

<p>Of Mrs. James's previous history, nothing has been published.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>
She was a friend of the Methodists, and of Wesley,
as well as of Whitefield. Only six weeks before her
marriage, Wesley was her guest, at Abergavenny, and writes,
"She received us gladly, as she had done aforetime."<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>
Exactly a month before she became Mrs. Whitefield, Wesley
was again in the same neighbourhood, and was warmly
attacked by his quondam friends, but now his Calvinistic
foes, Thomas Bissicks and Joseph Humphreys. Mrs. James
kindly interfered, and Wesley, not without reason, calls her
"a woman of candour and humanity."<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span></p>

<p>Whitefield did everything religiously. On the day before
his marriage, writing to Earl Leven, he remarks:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I find a restraint upon me now, so that I cannot write. God calls me
to retirement, being to enter the marriage state to-morrow. I am persuaded
your lordship will not fail to pray, that we may, like Zacharias and
Elisabeth, walk in all the ordinances and commandments of the Lord
blameless."</p></blockquote>

<p>Five days subsequent to his marriage, he says, to a friend
at Edinburgh, "On Saturday, I was married, in the fear of
God, to one who, I hope, will be a helpmeet to me. I
expect to be in London in about three weeks. My wife I
shall leave in the country for some time."</p>

<p>To another friend in Edinburgh he writes: "Jesus was
called to, Jesus was present at, the marriage." In a letter
to James Habersham, he says: "The Lord has given me a
wife. Her name was James, a widow, between thirty and
forty years of age. She has been a housekeeper many years.
Once gay; but, for three years last past, a despised follower
of the Lamb of God. I left her about three weeks ago, and
am going to settle affairs, and bring her up to London."
Shortly after, writing to his friend Gilbert Tennent, he
remarked: "About eleven weeks ago, I married, in the
fear of God, one who was a widow, of about thirty-six
years of age, and who has been a housekeeper for many
years; neither rich in fortune,<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> nor beautiful as to her
person, but, I believe, a true child of God, and one who
would not, I think, attempt to hinder me in His work for
the world. In that respect, I am just the same as before
marriage. I hope God will never suffer me to say, 'I have
married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.'"</p>

<p>These are all the references which Whitefield makes to
the new relationship into which he had so recently entered.
Why did he marry? That is a question which cannot easily
be answered, unless it be supposed that he wanted a matron
for his Orphan House, in Georgia. Men like Whitefield and
Wesley, almost always from home, ought to remain unmarried.
Their wives, naturally enough, very often become <em>Xantippes</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span></p>

<p>The <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>, when it announced Whitefield's
marriage, referred its readers to a prayer, in his last
Journal, which was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Northampton, October 19, 1740. Mrs. Edwards" (wife of the celebrated
Jonathan Edwards) "is a woman adorned with a meek and quiet
spirit. She talked feelingly and solidly of the things of God, and seemed
to be such a helpmeet for her husband, that she caused me to renew those
prayers, which, for some months, I have put up to God, that He would
send me a daughter of Abraham to be my wife. I find, upon many
accounts, it is my duty to marry. Lord, I desire to have no choice of my
own. Thou knowest my circumstances. Thou knowest I only desire to
marry in and for Thee. Thou didst choose a Rebecca for Isaac; choose
one for me, to be a helpmeet for me, in carrying on that great work
committed to my charge! Lord, hear me! Let my cry come unto
Thee!"</p></blockquote>

<p>Southey flatly asserts that Whitefield's "marriage was not
a happy one,"<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> but adduces no evidence in proof of this.
Cornelius Winter also says: "Mr. Whitefield was not happy
in his wife, but I fear some, who had not all the religion they
professed, contributed to his infelicity. He did not intentionally
make his wife unhappy. He always preserved great
decency and decorum in his conduct towards her. Her death
set his mind much at liberty. She certainly did not behave
in all respects as she ought. She could be under no temptation
from his conduct towards the sex, for he was a very pure
man, a strict example of the chastity he inculcated upon
others."<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> Great importance has been attached to this
account, because Cornelius Winter was an inmate of Whitefield's
house; but it is only fair to add, that Winter was not
born until a year after Whitefield's marriage, and that his
introduction to Whitefield's house was within a year and a
half of Mrs. Whitefield's death. On the other hand, as the
reader will hereafter find, Whitefield not unfrequently speaks
of his wife in endearing terms; and, in 1768, he preached
her funeral sermon, and praised her many virtues. She
also, on more than one occasion, evinced qualities of mind
deserving more than ordinary commendation. Three years
after her marriage, whilst she and Whitefield were on their
way to Georgia, the ship in which they sailed was threatened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
by an enemy. Guns were mounted, and chains put about
the masts. The wildest confusion reigned, and Whitefield
confessed that he was "naturally a coward;" but his wife
"set about making cartridges," and did her utmost in having
all things ready for the "fire and smoke."<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> At another
time, when a mob gathered round her husband, and stones
flew in all directions, and the great preacher began to fear,
she, who was standing by his side, pulled his gown, and cried,
with genuine heroism, "Now, George, play the man for God."
Such a woman would almost seem to have deserved more
attention than it was possible for her husband to pay her.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, it is a fact, that, within a week after
his marriage, Whitefield again started out on his evangelistic
ramblings, leaving his newly wedded wife behind him in
Wales.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> A few extracts from his letters, written at this
period, will illustrate the principles and actions of the man.</p>

<p>Lady Dirleton was one of the "honourable women" with
whom Whitefield became acquainted in Scotland; and to
her he addressed the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Bristol</span>, <em>November 22, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Honoured Madam</span>,&mdash;Your ladyship enjoys great advantages, and
glorious means of making progress in spiritual things. You are rich in
this world's goods: may God make you rich in faith and good works!
It gives me comfort to think, what sweet freedom I have enjoyed, when
opening the Scriptures in your ladyship's house. Surely, God was with
us of a truth. In Wales, we had much of the Divine presence. The
people there are so hungry after the word, that they are resolved not to
leave wrestling with the Most High, till He shall be pleased to send me
thither. I think I can say, that God brings me nearer and nearer to
Himself daily; and I will not rest, till I am moulded into the image of my
bleeding Lord. I pray God, that your ladyship may be content with no
degrees of holiness; but may be daily pressing forward, till you arrive at
the mark of the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus."</p></blockquote>

<p>To a friend in Edinburgh, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Bristol</span>, <em>November 27, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"I am resolved not to rest till everything, contrary to true, catholic,
Christian love, be rooted out of my soul. Christ's blood and Spirit are
able to do this for me. I only need to pray to God to make me willing
to have it done. I believe I shall see greater things than ever. We cannot
expect too great things from God."</p></blockquote>

<p>To a friend in London, he remarked:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Bristol</span>, <em>November 30, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"I rejoice that your soul is thirsting for holiness. God grant it may
never cease till you experience the full and glorious liberty of His children!
I see plainly how Satan loves to drive to extremes. Since there is no
such thing as having the in-being of sin destroyed, he would not have
people press after a delivery from the power of it. This also is owing to
the corruption of our hearts. The old man doth not love to be crucified
and slain; but I hope the language of your heart and mine is this&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Reign in me, Lord, Thy foes control,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>"No wonder, when we come to be thus minded, if carnal ministers,
and carnal professors of all kinds, cry out against us. Nay, even some
who have tasted that the Lord is gracious, having slumbered and slept,
and mixed too much with the world, even such frequently fight against
their privileges, and rest in an infant state of piety. But, I believe, the
Lord will rouse them, and let the world know what the blood of Jesus
can and will do. Blessed be His name! we have a growing church at
Bristol. Yesterday, and several other times, the Lord has filled many, as
with new wine. Sometimes, I scarce have known whether I have been in
or out of the body; but, I find, the more I receive of grace, the more I
desire to lie as a poor, very poor sinner, at the feet of Christ. Several
have just now been with me, who have, this last week, drunk deep of
Divine love. They are now full of the comforts of the Holy Ghost. Let
us, my dear brother, live a life of great nearness to Jesus; and labour day
by day to perfect holiness in the fear of God. There is a glorious rest to
be entered into even here. May the Lord make us partakers of it!"</p></blockquote>

<p>These are notable extracts. Their tone and language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
are remarkably different from the tone and language of
Whitefield's previous correspondence. Strangely enough,
though fresh from Calvinistic Scotland, he was evidently
veering round to something like Wesley's doctrine of Christian
perfection. In 1740, the two Wesleys had published
a volume of "Hymns and Sacred Poems," with a preface, in
which Wesley propounded his views of Christian holiness in
language the strongest he ever used. Indeed, in after life,
he himself modified several of the expressions in this remarkable
preface, and honestly admitted that some of them
were far too strong. The hymns, and especially the preface,
when first published, greatly disturbed Whitefield's serenity,
and, no doubt, partly led to the temporary estrangement
between him and Wesley, which had then occurred. But,
notwithstanding this, in the foregoing letter, Whitefield
breathes out the desires of his soul, in three of the most
forcibly worded verses in Wesley's book. It is true, he
slightly alters the phraseology, and likewise injures it; but
there is no material alteration of sentiment. The verses, as
the Wesleys published them, were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Reign in me, Lord, Thy foes control,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Who would not own Thy sway;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Diffuse Thy image through my soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Shine to the perfect day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Scatter the last remains of sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And seal me Thine abode;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O make me glorious all within,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">A temple built by God.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">My inward holiness Thou art,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For faith hath made Thee mine:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With all Thy fulness fill my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Till all I am is Thine!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such was part of Wesley's hymn on "Christ our Sanctification.
Stronger language, on the subject, he never used;
and, yet, this was now the language of his friend Whitefield.
If the views of the two were not perfectly identical, there
certainly was a near approach, on the part of Whitefield, to
the doctrine Wesley taught. Why was this? There can be
little doubt, that, it was greatly owing to the brotherly influence
of Howell Harris. To a large extent, Whitefield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
had been made the tool of excited partisans, both in London
and in Bristol. The men were violently opposed to Wesley,
but were too small to even think of conquering him, without
Whitefield's aid. Whitefield was naturally unsuspicious, and,
he was also fond of being regarded and consulted as a leader.
Wesley's opponents knew all this, and used their opportunity
for annoying him. Bitter complaints were made to
Whitefield, respecting the doctrines that he taught. Whitefield,
whose heart was always better than his head, became
confused, and he was induced to strongly condemn some of
Wesley's doctrines, without really understanding what they
were. Estrangement followed; and, for the last six months,
the two old friends had been divided. During Whitefield's
visit to Scotland, Howell Harris seems to have acted as his
curate, in London; where he also had an important interview
with the Wesley brothers. Hence the following, addressed
to Whitefield:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<em>October, 1741.</em>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Brother Whitefield</span>,&mdash;I believe that jealousies will not be
entirely eradicated until correspondence with those who indulge a party-spirit,
and are not like little children, ceases. I have seen, more than
ever, since I came home, what carnal professors are.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> The Lord has
helped me to bear my testimony against sin, and to declare that all those
who labour for deliverance from the dominion of sin, self, and unbelief,
shall be set free; they shall so behold the glory of God in the face of
Jesus Christ, as to be changed into His image, from glory to glory, as by
the Spirit of the Lord (2 Cor. iii. 18; Rom. vi. 14, viii. 2; 2 Peter i. 4;
and 2 Cor. v. 15). When I mentioned this liberty from the power of sin,
I was abused as one holding sinless perfection; and, I find, they have
troubled you with this information. I have always stated, that the body
of sin remains in believers, but that the power of it is destroyed. By
dwelling on sanctification, we shall find self and carnal reason in arms
against us; just the same as the pride of the Pharisees is against us,
when we preach justification by faith. These opposers would be glad to
influence you. They were in hopes to set brother Cennick and myself by
the ears, but the Lord disappointed them.</p>

<p>"Now, as to brother Wesley. The Lord gave me, on a certain day, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
earnestness to pray for him, and such faith that he would be led into all
truth, that all my prejudices were removed, and I felt I could speak to
him in love. Still, I had no thoughts of so doing, until he invited me to
visit him. Then I opened my heart to him, and told him how the Lord
taught me every truth. He allowed everything, and said, that we, through
grace, shall not fall away. I saw room to hope, that the Lord would
bring us together in truth.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> As to free-will, he utterly denied it. He does
really mean what he says. He did so openly, in Charles Square. 'God,'
said he, 'is willing to save you all, if you will. What I mean by saying
<em>if you will</em>, is, not if you have a faint wish to go to heaven, but, if you will
submit to Christ, in all His offices, for salvation&mdash;if you are willing He
should save you from sin, as well as hell; else you cannot be saved.'</p>

<p>"Brother Charles Wesley came to town last Saturday night, and we
providentially met. He owned he had no free-will until four years ago;
that it was God who chose him first; and not he God: and that he is
kept faithful by the faithfulness of God. He spoke tenderly of you, and
seemed to be quite loving and teachable."<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Harris's letter seems to have touched Whitefield, and to
have filled his heart with a gush of warm affection, which
found utterance in the following letter, which he, immediately,
wrote to Wesley:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Aberdeen</span>, <em>October, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and dear Brother</span>,&mdash;I have for a long time expected
that you would have sent me an answer to my last; but, I suppose, you
are afraid to correspond with me, because I revealed your secret about the
'<em>lot</em>.'" (See p. 469.) "Though much may be said for my doing it, yet
I am sorry now that any such thing dropped from my pen, and I humbly
ask pardon. I find I love you as much as ever; and pray God, if it be
His blessed will, that we may be all united together.</p>

<p>"For some days, it has been upon my mind to write to you, and this
morning I received a letter from brother Harris, telling me how he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
conversed with you and your dear brother. May God remove all obstacles
that now prevent our union! Though I hold particular election, yet I
offer Jesus freely to every individual soul. You may carry sanctification
to what degrees you will, only I cannot agree that the in-being of sin is
to be destroyed in this life.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear brother, the Lord has been much with me in Scotland.
I every morning feel fellowship with Christ, and He is pleased to give me
peace and joy in believing.</p>

<p>"In about three weeks, I hope to be at Bristol. May all disputings
cease, and each of us talk of nothing but Jesus, and Him crucified! This
is my resolution. The Lord be with your spirit!</p>

<p class="sig">
"I am, without dissimulation, ever yours,<br />

"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>When Whitefield arrived in Bristol, Wesley was recovering
from a severe and dangerous fever; and, though neither of
them mentions the fact, there can be little doubt, that the
old friends met, and conversed together, as Whitefield proposed
they should. As noticed in foregoing pages, Whitefield,
to some extent, misunderstood and mis-stated Wesley's
doctrine of Christian holiness; and as it is probable that
explanations were given during the interview at Bristol, there
is now no difficulty in understanding the alteration of tone
and language in Whitefield's letters already quoted. Though
in a mystic way still clinging to what he calls the "in-being
of sin" in all believers, Whitefield was now, in reality, seeking
the sanctification which Wesley taught.</p>

<p>On December 4, Whitefield arrived in London, from
which he had been absent the last four months. Three days
afterwards, he wrote as follows to James Habersham:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>December 7, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Friend and Brother</span>,&mdash;I came hither last Friday, and
received a packet of letters from Bethesda. When I read brother Grant's
account of the circumstances of the family, I remembered what the Lord
pressed upon my soul on shipboard: 'The bridegroom shall be taken from
them, and then shall they fast in those days.' However, be not discouraged.
Professor Francke's students were once obliged to sell their
clothes to buy candles.</p>

<p>"The work of God advances here greatly. We have a large Society,
consisting of several hundreds; and a noble place to meet in. I have
called it a <em>Tabernacle</em>, because, perhaps, we may be called to move our
tents.</p>

<p>"In Wiltshire, and at Kingswood, there are many good souls, and two
new houses built. In Wales, the door is opened wider than ever. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
work is very extraordinary in Scotland. I hear, daily, accounts of its
continuance and increase.</p>

<p>"God is pleased to let me feel more of His power than ever. O that
His whole mind were in me! I hunger and thirst after righteousness.
Blessed be God! there is a promise that such shall be filled.</p>

<p>"The Lords see through Mr. Garden's enmity, and will have nothing to
do with my Appeal; so that a hook is put into the leviathan's jaws.</p>

<p class="sig">
"Ever, ever yours in Christ,<br />

"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was Whitefield's letter <em>to</em> America. <em>From</em> America,
he received one equally inspiriting. The Rev. Thomas
Prince wrote to him as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, <em>December 6, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Since my last, our exalted Saviour has
been riding forth in His magnificence and glory, through divers parts of
our land, in so triumphant a manner as hath never been seen or heard
among us, or among any other people, since the days of the apostles. He
is daily making His most resolute opposers to fall down under Him.
Almost every week, we hear of new and surprising conquests. Some,
who were like incarnate devils, are thrown, at once, into such extreme
distress as no pen can possibly describe and, in two or three days, are
turned into saints, full of divine adoration, and love, and joy unspeakable,
and full of glory. Amazing works of this kind are now going on at
Taunton, Middleborough, Bridgewater, Abington, York, Ipswich, Rowley,
Cape Anne, Rittery, and Berwick. On a day of fasting and prayer at
Portsmouth, the Spirit of God came down, and seized the people by
scores and hundreds; and, in three days, there were a thousand in that
town in deep distress about their souls."<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>After spending a few days in London, Whitefield started
out to join his newly wedded wife at Abergavenny. On his
way, he spent about a week at Gloucester, where he wrote
the two following letters, the first to Lord Rae in Scotland,
and the second to his lay-curate, John Cennick, in London.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Gloucester</span>, <em>December 19, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;In England, as well as in Scotland, the Redeemer is
riding on from conquering to conquer. I have lately been at Bristol and
London, and have had the pleasure of seeing the Church walk in the
comforts of the Holy Ghost. I have preached here twice every day, for
some days past. I am athirst for holiness. I see such beauty and transcendent
excellencies in Christ, that I long to have His whole mind and
image stamped upon my soul. Nothing can satisfy me but the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
degrees of sanctification and inward holiness. Here, I believe, I am
laudably ambitious. My Saviour wills my sanctification. My Saviour
would have me filled with all the fulness of God."</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Gloucester</span>, <em>December 22, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,&mdash;Last Thursday evening, the Lord brought me
hither. I preached immediately to our friends in a large barn, and had
my Master's presence. On Friday and Saturday, I preached again twice.
On Sunday, God opened a door for my preaching in St. John's, one of the
parish churches. The late incumbent had been my grand opposer. He being
dead, and the new minister not having taken possession, the power of the
pulpit was in the churchwardens' hands. God inclined them to let me
preach there on Sunday morning and yesterday afternoon. On Sunday
afternoon, after I had preached twice at Gloucester, I preached at Mr.
F&mdash;&mdash;'s, six miles off; and again, at night, at Stroud. The people seem
to be more hungry than ever, and the Lord to be more amongst them.
Yesterday morning, I preached at Painswick, in the parish church; here
in the afternoon; and again, at night, in the barn. God gives me unspeakable
comfort, and uninterrupted joy. There seems to be a new
awakening, and a revival of the work of God. To-morrow morning, I
purpose to set out for Abergavenny."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, after a long interval, was Whitefield allowed to
occupy two of the pulpits of the Established Church. In
four days, he had been to Abergavenny, and had come back
to Bristol; where he wrote the following racy letter to a
gentleman in London:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Bristol</span>, <em>December 28, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;</span>, Both my wife and I received your letters. I
send this to thank you for them. I came from Abergavenny on Saturday
night. My dear wife was pretty well; I expect her here on Friday.</p>

<p>"We shall bring no more goods to London than we shall use; but I
know not what to say about coming to your house, for, I am told, you and
your wife are dilatory, and that you do not rise sometimes till nine or ten
in the morning. This will never do for me; and, I am persuaded, such
conduct tends much to the dishonour of God, and to the prejudice of your
own precious soul. Sometimes I have looked upon you with grief. You
have busied yourself about the outward affairs of religion with respect to
others, and, all the while, I fear, neglected the improvement of your own
heart. I fear your present business will not answer; and, I am sure, you
will have no solid comfort, till you look less abroad and more at home.
Somebody said, you were like the Athenians, who desired to hear some
new thing. I thought the observation was too just. You are jealous
about principles, which is right; but, all the while, your own practice is not
sufficiently watched over. I have heard you spend much time in coffee
houses, and from your own house. I hope these things are not so.
You will not be offended with me for this plain dealing. You know I love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
you; and, I am sure, this letter proceeds from love. The eyes of the
world are now in an especial manner upon you. Labour, therefore, my
dear brother, to get an abiding presence of God in your heart. Be willing
to be searched. Pray that you may feel the full power of the Redeemer's
blood. Be not slothful in business. Go to bed seasonably, and rise
early. Redeem your precious time. Pick up all the fragments of it, that
not one moment may be lost. Be much in secret prayer. Converse less
with man, and more with God. Accept this advice, given in great love."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another letter, of the same date, must have insertion. It
is a striking fact, that, though all of them distinct, there
were, at the same time, remarkable religious movements in
America, England, Scotland, and Wales. The labours and
successes of Howell Harris, in the last-mentioned country,
have been already noticed. About half a score clergymen
of the Established Church had practically identified
themselves with him, and had become itinerant preachers.
Among these, were the Rev. Daniel Rowlands, the Rev.
William Williams, the Rev. Peter Williams, and the Rev.
Howell Davies. A considerable body of lay-preachers, also,
had sprung into existence; and the Methodist congregations
and Societies of the principality were daily increasing in
number and importance.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> To these Welsh evangelists, in
one of their assemblies, Whitefield addressed the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Bristol</span>, <em>December 28, 1741</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Brethren in Christ</span>,&mdash;Though obliged to be absent in
body, I write this to assure you of my being present in spirit. I wish you
much of the presence of our glorious Head. I doubt not but you will
find Him faithful to His promise, and, as you meet together in His name,
He certainly will be in the midst of you. The affairs you meet about are
affairs of the utmost importance. You ought to watch close, and to be instant
in prayer; for you need much of the wisdom which cometh from above.</p>

<p>"One great matter is rightly to know to what particular office, and to
what particular part, Jesus Christ has called each of you. For, I take it
for granted, none of you will presume to run before you are called, or have
evidences of your own conversion. Different persons have different gifts
and graces. Some are called to awaken; others to establish and build up.
Some have popular gifts fit for large auditories; others move best in a
more contracted sphere, and may be exceeding useful in the private
Societies. Those who are called to act in a public manner, I think,
ought to give themselves wholly to the work, and go out without purse or
scrip. Their Master will bear their charges. Others, who can only visit
privately, may mind their secular employ, and give their leisure time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
the service of the Church. Some of you are ministers of the Church of
England; but, if you are faithful, I cannot think you will continue in it
long. However, do not go out till you are cast out; and, when cast out
for Jesus Christ's sake, be not afraid to preach in the fields. And whilst
you remain in, O let not the children of God starve for want of the
sacrament, though they may belong to another parish. The canon which
forbids giving it to <em>strangers</em> was only to prevent persons coming unprepared,
without the minister's knowledge. It is regarded by none of the
clergy; and nothing but the enmity of the old serpent excites them to
mention it to any of you. For my own part, I should think it an honour
to be put into the spiritual court, and to be excommunicated, for giving
the children of God the sacrament at my church, when they cannot have
it elsewhere. The Spirit of Christ and of glory, I am sure, would rest upon
my soul.</p>

<p>"As for those who are not ordained, I cannot say much, only pray that
each may take his proper place. If Brother Lewis could come over and
help us, it would be well. The Church here wants more labourers. It is
proper, somebody should be always in Wiltshire and Kingswood. I wish
also you could meet monthly; if not all together, yet in little bodies, as you
lie nearest to each other. I am about to settle a monthly meeting in
Bristol and London, where correspondents' letters are to be read, and
prayer made accordingly. If you had monthly meetings, each exhorter
or labourer might communicate his success; an abstract might be sent to
England; and we, in return, would send you an abstract of our affairs.
Unity would thereby be promoted, love increased, and our hands
strengthened.</p>

<p>"All this may be done without a formal separation from the Established
Church, which I cannot think God calls for as yet; only, I think, if a
brother or sister has a mind to communicate among the Dissenters, and
has freedom to receive in the Church too, they ought to be left at their
liberty.</p>

<p>"Thus, my dear brethren, I have given you what occurred to my mind.
I am ashamed whilst I am writing, knowing my insufficiency to advise.
But you will accept in love, from one who desires to be the servant of all.
It may be, hereafter, God may bring me to you, and we may enjoy sweet
fellowship together. In the meanwhile, I commend you to God, and to
the word of His grace. I entreat your most earnest prayer in behalf of,
dear brethren, your most affectionate, though most unworthy, brother and
servant,</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>There is much in this important letter which deserves
attention; but the intelligent reader can easily form his own
opinions on the topics it embraces.</p>

<p>As usual, Whitefield was greatly occupied with his Orphan-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
affairs. His scheme, as he himself originally propounded
it, was benevolently comprehensive.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"An orphan house," he wrote in 1739, "is much wanted at Savannah;
for there are many orphans, who, now being obliged to live in the families
about town, lose all the advantages they receive at school.</p>

<p>"Besides, it will be a great encouragement to people to go to the colony,
when they are assured their children will be provided for after their
decease; and it will be an unspeakable comfort to parents already there,
who fear nothing so much as having their children left destitute when they
are dead.</p>

<p>"Further, if the Indians, who live near the town, can be persuaded to
send their children, it seems to be the only probable means to bring about
their conversion.</p>

<p>"It may be further considered, that the children, to be maintained in
the Orphan House, are to be bred up to manual labour from their very
infancy; and that the persons to be employed in their education, it is to
be hoped, have the glory of God at heart, and desire no other gratuity
than food and raiment.</p>

<p>"Part also of the Orphan House is to be set apart for an infirmary,
where sick servants and poor people, who now are in great danger of
perishing for want of necessaries, are to be taken in and provided for;
which must be a great ease and assistance, not only to the servants, but to
masters and mistresses of families, who cannot afford to have physicians,
or to furnish sick servants with things convenient."<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>All must admit the benevolent character of Whitefield's
project. The difficulties he had to encounter were enormous.
Again and again, he was in danger of being arrested
for the debts that he had incurred in the erection of his large
building. Providence, however, provided for his necessities;
and now his Orphanage was opened, and his plans were
being carried out. He had many friends; but he also had
some enemies. Among the latter was a Mr. Nesbit, who
had recently returned to England from Carolina, where he
had lived thirty years. In three letters, published in the
<cite>Scots' Magazine</cite> for 1741, Mr. Nesbit alleged, that "the
extraordinary expense, in building the Orphan House, might
have been saved, by appropriating one or more of the empty
houses in Savannah," where Whitefield "might have had his
choice of hundreds." Mr. Nesbit continues: "The colony
of Georgia has been dwindling away for two or three years
past, by reason of the oppressions the people have suffered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
Of the thousands sent over by the Trustees, only a few
families remain, and they are waiting an opportunity to get
out of the arbitrary government of the place. Savannah is
now two-thirds desolate; and, except the few people in that
town, there is scarce an inhabitant within sixty or seventy
miles of the Orphan House. Of what use can an hospital
be in a desert and abandoned country? or how can such a
house be maintained in that situation, exposed to Spaniards,
Indians, and runaway negroes?" Another of Mr. Nesbit's
complaints was that Whitefield had "paid £3 for each cow
and calf, whereas the price in Carolina was only thirty
shillings;" and that the keeping of his live stock was costing
twice as much as it ought to cost. "Thousands of pounds,"
says the censor, "have been expended on the Orphan House,
and it is not above half finished. Mr. Whitefield has paid
twice as much for his boards, planks, and scantlings, as he
should have done."</p>

<p>It is not unlikely that simple-minded Whitefield was
cheated by the worldly-wise colonists with whom he had
business transactions; but that he did his best cannot reasonably
be doubted. Nesbit's letters were published while
Whitefield was in Scotland, and was making collections for
the Orphanage. Whitefield wrote two replies, one dated
September 26, and the other October 3, 1741; and both
were published in the <cite>Scots' Magazine</cite>. A brief extract
from the second must suffice. In answer to the allegation
that the expense of building might have been saved
by using empty houses in Savannah, Whitefield writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I tried this experiment while the Orphan House was building. I gave
Mr. Douglas £35 a year for his house, the largest in Savannah. I had
the use of the parsonage, the Germans' house, and another house besides;
all of which, put together, were scarcely sufficient; and, if I had had to
pay rent for them all, they would have cost upwards of £50, if not £60,
per annum. Judge you, then, whether it was not better to build one large,
convenient house, than to be at such an annual expenditure for rent, and
to undergo the inconvenience of living in separate houses.</p>

<p>"I fear you have been misinformed that, excepting a few people in
Savannah, there is scarce an inhabitant within sixty or seventy miles of
the Orphan House; for, within four or five miles, there are Mr. Fallowfield's
plantation, Mr. Parker's plantation (both magistrates of Savannah),
Colonel Stevens's plantation, Mr. Mercer's plantation, with some others a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
little farther distant; besides three hundred Saltzburghers not above forty
miles distant from us."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield adds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Orphan House has been the support of the northern parts of the
colony. It has been the means of bringing several children out of a state
little better than slavery. It has enabled many a man to pay his debts.
Above all, it has been the means, under God, of bringing many a poor
soul to the knowledge of the Lord Jesus, which was my chief end in
building it. Whilst I have this single end in view, I fear neither Spaniards'
swords, nor the scourges of men's tongues. My motto is 'the Burning
Bush.' You know, that burnt, but was not consumed."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was a part of Whitefield's answer to Mr. Nesbit. At
the end of the year, he published "An Account of Money
received and disbursed for the Orphan House in Georgia"
(8vo. 45 pp.), with a preface, dated December 23, 1741.
Extracts from this have been already given; but, as a further
refutation of Mr. Nesbit's allegations, the following extract
from a letter, written by a gentleman from Boston, who had
visited the Orphan House, will, it is hoped, interest the
reader. The letter is dated "Bethesda, January 1, 1742."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Orphan House is pleasantly situated, and, with the buildings
belonging to it, presents a much handsomer prospect than is given by the
draught annexed to the public accounts. The great house is now almost
finished; and nothing has hindered but the want of glass, which they
daily expect from Bristol, and some bricks to carry up another stack
of chimneys, which would have been done before, if a vessel that was
bringing bricks and other stores had not been taken by the Spaniards.
They have cut a fine road to Savannah, through a thicket of woods; and,
that it might be passable, were obliged to make ten bridges and crossways.
They have also cleared forty acres of land, twenty of which were
planted the last year; the other twenty were for the benefit of the air.
They have also a large garden at the front of the house, brought into
pretty good order. If the colony be allowed negroes, as it is thought it
must and will be, they can, with about twenty negroes to manure the
plantation, which contains five hundred acres, raise much more provision
than a larger family than this can expend. They have already a fine live
stock; and, in a few years, it is to be hoped, they will be able to support
themselves.</p>

<p>"The economy observed here is as follows: The bell rings in the
morning at sunrise, to wake the family. When the children arise, they
sing a short hymn, and pray by themselves. Then they go down to wash,
and, by the time they have done that, the bell calls to public worship,
when a portion of Scripture is read and expounded, a psalm sung, and
the exercise begun and ended with prayer. Then they breakfast, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
afterwards go, some to their trades, and the rest to their prayers and
schools. At noon, they all dine in the same room, and have comfortable
and wholesome diet provided. A hymn is sung before and after dinner;
then, in about half an hour, to school again; an interval which affords
time enough for recreation. A little after sunset, the bell calls to public
duty again, which is performed in the same manner as in the morning.
After that they sup, and are attended to bed by one of their masters, who
then prays with them. On the Sabbath day, they all dine on cold meat
provided the day before, that none may be kept from public worship,
which is attended four times a day in summer, and three in the winter.
The children are kept to reading between whiles. Many have reported
that the place is very unhealthy; but I believe it is quite otherwise; a
remarkable proof of which is, that not one of the family has died, and but
three or four in the hospital. Many, who now think the erecting of the
Orphan House a mad scheme, would alter their sentiments were they
here. Innumerable difficulties have been overcome, and affairs now wear
a pleasant aspect. Upon the whole, I think the institution to be of God;
therefore, it doth and will prosper."</p></blockquote>

<p>The reader has here as full a description of the Orphan
House in 1741, as can well be given.</p>

<p>Nearly all the printed attacks on Whitefield, during the
year 1741, have been already noticed; but it may be added,
that, in this year, the following tracts were published by his
friend Wesley, not exactly against Whitefield, but against
the doctrines he held:&mdash;1. "Serious Considerations on Absolute
Predestination. Extracted from a late Author."<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
(12mo. 24 pp.) 2. "The Scripture Doctrine concerning
Predestination, Election, and Reprobation. Extracted from
a late Author." (12mo. 16 pp.) 3. "A Dialogue between
a Predestinarian and his Friend." (12mo. 7 pp.) 4. "Christian
Perfection: a Sermon preached by John Wesley, M.A.,
Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford." (12mo. 12 pp.)</p>

<p>The Bishop of London, also, in his Charge to the Clergy
of his Diocese, had a fling at the erratic evangelist, telling
his reverend brethren, that, Whitefield had slandered the
Church and clergy; for he had "publicly spread and
avowed, in a very unworthy and licentious manner, that
the generality of the clergy of the Church of England were
shamefully remiss and negligent in the <em>pastoral</em> office."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span></p>

<p>And once more: An anonymous author published an
8vo. pamphlet of thirty-six pages, with the title, "The
Controversy concerning Free-will and Predestination, set in
a <em>true light</em>, and brought to a <em>short issue</em>. Recommended
to Mr. Whitefield and his followers." In his preface, the
writer taunts Whitefield "as an oracle, most <em>implicitly</em>
believing that he is <em>inspired</em> by the Holy Ghost." He continues:
"With undaunted assurance, Mr. Whitefield takes
upon him to instil this abominable doctrine of Predestination
into his hearers and admirers&mdash;a doctrine which runs counter
to revelation, and to the blessed nature of God; which
depreciates the merits and satisfaction of Jesus Christ in the
grand atonement; which sets the Divine attributes out of
harmony; which makes prayer useless, and the command
to pray an imposition; which makes God partial, arbitrary,
despotic, unjust, and cruel; and which makes the Christian
priesthood and sacraments, at least, insignificant. Who can
reasonably doubt, that there is a plot of Satan and his
emissaries, to promote infidelity by this; and, perhaps, to
make way for popery, on the principle, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Divide et impera</i>&mdash;divide
and govern"?</p>

<p>The author dates his pamphlet, "November 24, 1741,"
and concludes it with the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Why is this <em>wrangling world</em> thus <em>toss'd</em> and <em>torn</em>?</span><br />
<span class="i1"><em>Free-grace</em>, <em>free-will</em>, are both together born.</span><br />
<span class="i1">If God's <em>free-grace</em> rule in and over me,</span><br />
<span class="i1">His <em>will</em> is <em>mine</em>, and so my <em>will</em> is <em>free</em>."</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Whitefield closed the year 1741 in Bristol, and spent
nearly the whole of the first month of 1742 in the same
city. He preached twice every day; and was still ardently
desiring holiness. At the beginning of the year, he went to
hear Charles Wesley preach; and he also commenced the
monthly meeting, which he had mentioned in his letter to
the Welsh evangelists. Hence the following to a friend, in
London:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Bristol</span>, <em>January 2, 1742</em>.
</p>

<p>"My soul is thirsting after the Redeemer's love. I care not how the
old man be crucified, and cut to pieces, so that I may put on the new
man, which is created after God in righteousness and true holiness.
Great, very great things has Jesus done for me, a worthless worm; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
see infinitely greater things lying before me. There is an inexhaustible
fulness in Jesus Christ, out of which I hope to draw to the endless ages
of eternity. Oh the meekness, the love, and purity in Jesus! Why should
we be dwarfs in holiness?</p>

<p>"Yesterday I went to hear Mr. Charles. I believe the Lord helped
him in some parts of his discourse. I would be free; I would meet more
than half-way; but we are all too shy. The Lord fill his soul with more
of the disinterested love of Jesus!</p>

<p>"To-night, I begin a general monthly meeting to read corresponding
letters. Pray, give thanks for the success of the gospel in my unworthy
hands."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield left Bristol on January 22, and on the same
day preached twice at Tockington, a small village in
Gloucestershire. On the 23rd, he preached "to many thousands
at Stroud, with wondrous power." On the 25th, he
reached Gloucester, where he remained a fortnight, preaching
twice, and sometimes oftener, every day. The following are
extracts from letters, written during this visit to his native
city. To John Cennick, in London, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Gloucester</span>, <em>January 28, 1742</em>.
</p>

<p>"Our congregations here are larger than at Bristol. The word proves
sharper than a two-edged sword. Every sermon is blessed. I am just
now going to Chalford. To-morrow, I expect my wife. Sinless perfection,
I fear, will be propagated in these parts. The Lord, in His due time,
will root out that pernicious weed. God willing, I shall examine Hampton
Society to-night. I think to do the same in Wiltshire. I want to be in
London as soon as may be."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the same day, he wrote to Gilbert Tennent:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"God has been very good to me since my arrival in England. I found,
when I came at first, I had all my work to begin again. Brother Wesley
had so prejudiced the people against me, that those who were my spiritual
children would not so much as come and see me. Nay, they have gone
by me, whilst preaching in Moorfields, and stopped their ears. I was
also embarrassed by Brother Seward's death. He died without making
any provision for me; and, at the time, I was much indebted for the
Orphan House. All this was to humble me, and prepare me for future
blessings. The Lord has enabled me, blessed be His name! to keep
steady to my principles and usual practice. A new and numerous church
has been raised in London. In Essex, the Lord was wonderfully with
me. Everywhere, the congregations increase. In Bristol, God enabled
me to fight my way through. We have hired a large room, and have
expounded there twice a day. In Scotland, the work, for its beginning,
is greater than in New England. Through the tender mercies of our
God, I have been carried, as on eagles' wings, through a variety of outward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
and inward troubles, the greatness of which none knows but God
and my own soul. I am glad that matters are settling so amicably at
Philadelphia. What a pity it is that we should fall out in the way to
heaven! I would do anything except defiling my conscience, and giving
up what I think is truth, to prevent it. The Associate Brethren are much
to be blamed. I never met with such narrow spirits."</p></blockquote>

<p>To a friend, at New Brunswick, he remarked:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What have you to do but to walk humbly with your God, and daily to
aspire after the whole mind that was in Jesus? I find but few truly
labouring after this. For my own part, I am ashamed to think how
unlike I am to my Saviour. I see such beauty in Him, that I long to be
conformed to His image. Blessed be God! the work in our hands everywhere
increases. I am supported and encouraged, quickened and comforted,
day by day. Jesus loves and blesses me."</p></blockquote>

<p>On February 5, he wrote again to Gilbert Tennent:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reverend and dear Brother</span>,&mdash;On Tuesday, I received yours. I
thank you for your kind caution. My mistakes often humble me. Never
did Jesus send out a more weak and worthless wretch. I have not freedom
now to continue writing a journal, as usual. I shall proceed, for the
future, in a more compendious way."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield here makes a statement of great importance.
From December 28, 1737, to March 11, 1741; he had
written a copious journal of his experiences, labours, and
successes; and had published far more of it than was
expedient. Both friends and foes&mdash;in England, Scotland,
and America&mdash;had assailed him on this account, and not
without reason. Even he himself acknowledged the justice
of these attacks, when, in 1756, he published a new edition
of his Journals, "revised, corrected, and <em>abridged</em>." Unfortunately,
in an evil hour, he resolved to throw aside his
diary. Yes, <em>unfortunately</em>; for it cannot be denied, that,
diaries, properly written, by remarkable men, like Whitefield,
are an incalculable boon. Who could have adequately appreciated
Wesley's character, labours, and success, without
his <cite>Journals</cite>? And, to some extent, the same may be said
of Whitefield. There is a difference, however. Whitefield's
long and numerous letters, unlike Wesley's, were autobiographical.
His life cannot be written without his letters;
but with them such a work is not impossible. From his
return to England in 1741, he ceased to write Journals;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
but, to the end of life, he never lost his passion for writing
about himself, in correspondence with his friends.</p>

<p>One of the Oxford Methodists, the Rev. William Chapman,
was settled as a clergyman in Bath; and, to him,
Whitefield addressed the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Gloucester</span>, <em>February 5, 1742</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Friend and Brother</span>,&mdash;Yesterday, I preached three times,
and visited a private Society in the evening. To-day, I was enabled to
preach three times, with great power. Here there is such an awakening,
as I never saw in these parts before. It is pleasant to hear the people
come and tell how God wrought upon them by my unworthy ministry two
years ago. The fruits of the Spirit are now apparent in their lives.
Letters from Scotland bring blessed tidings, as also from Philadelphia.
O the blessed effects of field preaching! O that I were humble, and
thankful! Help me, my dear friend, to entreat the Redeemer to make me
as a little, a <em>very little child</em>. At the beginning of next week, I hope to
be in Bath; but cannot tell exactly the day. I thank my friends for their
kind intention to meet me; but I had rather avoid it. The less parade
the better. Let us stand still, and see the salvation of God. He will not
bless what doth not come from Himself."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield seems to have spent about a fortnight in Bath
and its neighbourhood. He then set out for London, and,
on the road, wrote the following almost ecstatic letter to a
distinguished lady with whom he had become acquainted in
Scotland. Lady Mary Hamilton was sister to William,
third Marquis of Lothian, the Countess of Home, Lady
Cranstown, and Lady Ross. Her ladyship's mother was
daughter of Archibald Campbell, the unfortunate Earl of
Argyll, who was beheaded in 1635. She had married
Alexander Hamilton of Ballincrieff, member of Parliament
for the county of Linlithgow, and Post-Master General of
Scotland. Mr. Hamilton, as well as his wife, was partial to
Whitefield's preaching, and always received him at his house
with every mark of polite attention. For six-and-twenty
years, until her death, in 1768, Lady Mary was one of
Whitefield's correspondents.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> His letter to this noble lady
cannot fail to be read with interest.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Thales, near Reading</span>, <em>February 23, 1742</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Honoured Madam</span>,&mdash;I am now upon the road to London. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
morning your acceptable letter came to hand. Though somewhat wearied,
I would fain answer it before I retire to rest.</p>

<p>"Blessed be God! who causes your ladyship to be never less alone,
than when alone. O Madam, what a Comforter is the Holy Ghost!
What sweet company is Jesus Christ! What a privilege is it to have
fellowship with the great Three-One! A world lying in wickedness
knows nothing of it. Everything yields comfort when the Spirit breathes
upon it.</p>

<p>"I am amazed that God should work by my hands; but Jesus is love.
He yet delights to honour me. I have lately seen the Redeemer riding in
His strength, and getting Himself the victory in poor sinners' hearts. O
that our Jesus may set the world in a flame of love! Hasten that time,
O blessed Jesus! O let Thy kingdom come!</p>

<p>"I have heard from my dear orphans to-day. They have been reduced
to straits; but the Lord has stirred up a wealthy friend or two to assist
them. I find there has been a fresh awakening among them. I am
informed that twelve negroes, belonging to a planter lately converted at
the Orphan House, are savingly brought home to Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that the work goes on in Scotland. The Lord, I
trust, will ripen your soul apace for glory. He has various ways of perfecting
His saints. Methinks, I see your ladyship sitting in your chair,
and ravished with the Redeemer's beauty. Sometimes you are, as it
were, washing His feet with your tears; at other times, sitting by faith at
His feet, and hearing or reading His word. Sometimes your heart is too
big to speak; then again, out of the abundance of your heart, your mouth
poureth forth hallelujahs. Sometimes you are lost in wonder; and at all
times longing to be dissolved, and to be with Christ. This, I trust, is the
life your ladyship lives. This is life indeed. They who live otherwise
are dead whilst they live. They call for our compassion and prayers; for
who has made the difference? Distinguishing grace! O the unsearchable
riches of Christ! I could speak of Him for ever. The Lord be with
your spirit, and abundantly bless both you, Mr. Hamilton, and your
child!"</p></blockquote>

<p>On arriving in London, Whitefield wrote to his friend
Mr. Noble, of New York, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>February 26, 1742</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My very dear Brother</span>,&mdash;Before yours came to hand, the Lord had
given me an enlarged heart, and unfeigned love and freedom, to converse
with all His dear children, of whatever denomination. I talk freely with
the Messrs. Wesley, though we widely differ in a certain point. Most
talk of a catholic spirit; but it is only till they have brought people into
the pale of their own church. This is downright sectarianism, not catholicism.
How can I act consistently, unless I receive and love all the
children of God, whom I believe to be such, of whatever denomination
they may be? Why should we dispute when there is no probability of
convincing? I am persuaded, the more the love of God is shed abroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
in our hearts, the more all narrowness of spirit will subside and give way.
Besides, so far as we are narrow-spirited, we are uneasy. Prejudices,
jealousies, and suspicions make the soul miserable. But enough of this.
My dear brother Noble is of my mind; only let me give you one caution.
Take heed that your getting acquainted with any new set of Christians
does not lead you insensibly to despise others of your old acquaintance.
Watch, and deal very tenderly with all; otherwise you will grow reserved
and artful, and will lose a simple, open, guileless spirit, before you are
aware."</p></blockquote>

<p>To the same effect is the following letter to the Rev.
William Chapman, of Bath:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>March 4, 1742</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Friend and Brother</span>,&mdash;I hope you are not offended,
because you did not see me in Bath again. The glorious Emmanuel
pointed out my way hither. Since I came, He has been wonderfully kind
to me, and to His people. I am much assisted daily, in preaching to poor
sinners the unsearchable riches of Christ. Life and power fly all around,
and the Redeemer is getting Himself the victory daily in many hearts.
O that my dear Mr. Chapman may be made a flaming fire, and a spiritual
father to thousands!</p>

<p>"I despair of a greater union among the churches, till a greater measure
of the Spirit be poured from on high. Hence, therefore, I am resolved
simply to preach the gospel of Christ, and leave others to quarrel by and
with themselves. To contend, where there is no probability of convincing,
only feeds and adds fuel to an unhallowed fire. Love, forbearance, long-suffering,
and frequent prayer to the Lord Jesus, is the best way to put it
out. O love&mdash;true, simple, Christian, undissembled love&mdash;whither art
thou fled?"</p></blockquote>

<p>The treatment he received from the Church of England,
and from Presbyterians in Scotland, and his differences with
the Wesleys, were not the only things that troubled Whitefield.
His evangelistic friends in Wales were not perfectly
harmonious; and there can hardly be a doubt that this was
one of the incidents which led him to write as he did in the
foregoing letters. Whitefield hated disputations; and yet,
even some of his dearest friends were sometimes in danger
of being divided by their religious contests. Hence the
following extract from a letter, written by Howell Harris to
Whitefield's wife:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">Lanworthadd</span>, <em>March 24, 1742</em>.
</p>

<p>"Our Society of ministers and exhorters go on sweetly. We had some
disputes the last time we met; but we never parted with such broken
hearts and wet cheeks. The Lord pities us, and will set us free from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
those strong corruptions, that set us together by the ears, and divide us,
and cool our love to each other."<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield sighed for union; and, by keeping apart from
controversy, and simply testifying the gospel of the grace of
God, he did his utmost to make professing Christians a
loving brotherhood. Sometimes, the prospect of this began
to brighten; and, at all times, he had reason to exult on
account of new conversions. The following extracts from
letters, that he wrote in the month of April, will be welcome:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>April 6, 1742</em>.
</p>

<p>"O what a blessing it is to be redeemed from a vain conversation!
O that every poor sinner felt it! Then would the children of God agree
in one, and divisions would be at an end. Blessed be our Lord! there is
a greater prospect of union than ever. It is what my soul longs after, and
labours for. It is a great pity that poor pilgrims should fall out in their
way to heaven; but this will be, till we get more of the Divine Spirit.</p>

<p>"I believe there is such a work begun, as neither we nor our fathers
have heard of. The beginnings are amazing; how unspeakably glorious
will the end be! In New England, the Lord takes poor sinners by hundreds,
I may say by thousands. In Scotland, the fruits of my poor labours
are abiding and apparent. In Wales, the word of the Lord runs and is
glorified; as also in many places in England. In London, our Saviour is
doing great things daily. We scarce know what it is to have a meeting
without tears. Our Lord always meets with us. I sleep and eat but little,
and am constantly employed from morning till midnight; and, yet, I walk
and am not weary, I run and am not faint. O free grace! It fires my
soul, and makes me long to do something more for Jesus. It is true,
indeed, I want to go home; but here are so many souls ready to perish
for lack of knowledge, that I am willing to tarry below, as long as my
Master has work for me to do."</p></blockquote>

<p>To John Cennick, now evangelizing in Whitefield's native
county, he wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>April 8, 1742</em>.
</p>

<p>"I rejoice to hear that the Lord is with you, and that He was pleased
to bless my poor labours in Gloucestershire. I would have you to dispute
as little as possible. Awakened souls should be told to look continually
to the Lord Jesus. Our Lord is with us much in London. I preach
twice daily. Our Society grows."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield longed for union; Wesley, for the present,
seems to have been indifferent concerning it, and was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
beset with those who wished to make him think that Whitefield
was not sincere. The following is a significant entry
in Wesley's Journal:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"1742. April 23. I spent an agreeable hour with Mr. Whitefield. I
believe he is sincere in all he says concerning his earnest desire of joining
hand in hand with all that love the Lord Jesus Christ. But, if (as some
would persuade me) he is not, the loss is all on his own side. I am just
as I was. I go on my way, whether he goes with me, or stays behind."<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield had now spent nearly two months of wintry
weather in the metropolis, and, of course, his ministry had
been mainly confined to his wooden meeting-house, in the
neighbourhood of Moorfields. At length, the sun was again
shining, the birds were singing, and the breezes balmy. It
was time for Whitefield to resume his "field-pulpit," and to
use the bright blue heavens as his sounding-board. During
the Easter holidays, commencing on Easter Monday, April
19, Whitefield preached six or seven sermons in his old
open-air cathedral, Moorfields;<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> and, writing to a friend in
Philadelphia, remarked, "We have had a glorious <em>Easter</em>, or
rather a <em>Pentecost</em>." The scenes witnessed on these three
memorable days&mdash;Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday&mdash;are
described by himself in two letters, written three weeks afterwards.
The letters are here thrown into one continuous
narrative.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">London</span>, <em>May 11, 1742</em>.
</p>

<p>"With this, I send you a few of the many notes I have received from
persons who were convinced, converted, or comforted in Moorfields,
during the late holidays. For many weeks, I found my heart much
pressed to preach there at this season, when Satan's children keep their
annual rendezvous.</p>

<p>"I must inform you, that Moorfields is a large, spacious place, given,
as I have been told, by one Madam Moore, for all sorts of people to divert
themselves in. For many years past, from one end to the other, booths
of all kinds have been erected, for mountebanks, players, puppet-shows,
and such-like.</p>

<p>"With a heart bleeding with compassion for so many thousands led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
captive by the devil at his will, on Easter Monday,<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> at six o'clock in the
morning, attended by a large congregation of praying people, I ventured
to lift up a standard amongst them, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
Perhaps, there were about ten thousand waiting, not for me, but for
Satan's instruments to amuse them. I was glad to find that, for once, I
had, as it were, got the start of the devil. I mounted my field-pulpit,<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> and
almost all flocked immediately around it. I preached on these words,
'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,' etc. They gazed, they
listened, they wept. All was hushed and solemn; and I believe many
felt themselves stung with deep conviction of their past sins.</p>

<p>"Being thus encouraged, I ventured out again at noon: but what a
scene! The fields, the whole fields, seemed, in a bad sense of the word,
all white, ready, not for the Redeemer's, but, for Beelzebub's harvest. All
his agents were in full motion, drummers, trumpeters, merry-andrews,
masters of puppet-shows, exhibitors of wild beasts, etc., etc.,&mdash;all busy in
entertaining their respective auditories. I suppose, there could not be less
than twenty or thirty thousand people.</p>

<p>"My pulpit was fixed on the opposite side, and immediately, to their
great mortification, they found the number of their attendants sadly
lessened. Judging that, like St. Paul, I should now be called, as it
were, to fight with beasts at Ephesus, I preached from these words:
'Great is Diana of the Ephesians.' You may easily guess, that there
was some noise among the craftsmen, and that I was honoured with
having stones, dirt, rotten eggs, and pieces of dead cats thrown at me,
whilst engaged in calling them from their favourite, but lying vanities.
My soul was indeed among lions; but far the greater part of my congregation
seemed to be turned into lambs.</p>

<p>"This encouraged me to give notice, that I would preach again at six
o'clock in the evening. I came, I saw, but what? Thousands and
thousands more than before, still more deeply engaged in their unhappy
diversions; but, among them, some thousands waiting as earnestly to
hear the gospel. This was what Satan could not brook. One of his
choicest servants was exhibiting, trumpeting on a large stage; but, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
soon as the people saw me, in my black robes, and my pulpit, I think, all
of them, to a man, left him and ran to me. For a while, I was enabled to
lift up my voice as a trumpet. God's people kept praying; and the
enemy's agents made a kind of roaring at some distance from us. At
length, they approached nearer, and the merry-andrew (who complained
that they had taken many pounds less that day on account of my preaching)
got upon a man's shoulders, and, advancing near the pulpit, attempted,
several times, to strike me with a long, heavy, whip; but always, with the
violence of his motion, tumbled down. Soon afterwards, they got a
recruiting sergeant, with his drum, etc., to pass through the congregation.
I gave the word of command, and ordered that way might be made for
the king's officer. The ranks opened, while all marched quietly through,
and then closed again. Finding those efforts to fail, a large body, on the
opposite side of the field, assembled together, and, having got a large pole
for their standard, advanced towards us with steady and formidable steps,
till they came very near the skirts of our congregation. I saw, gave
warning, and prayed to the Captain of our salvation for support and
deliverance. He heard and answered; for, just as they approached us,
with looks full of resentment, they quarrelled among themselves, threw
down their pole, and went their way, leaving, however, many of their
company behind. I think, I continued in praying, preaching, and singing
(for the noise, at times, was too great to preach), about three hours.</p>

<p>"We then retired to the Tabernacle. My pocket was full of notes
from persons brought under concern. I read, them, amidst the praises
and spiritual acclamations of thousands, who joined with the holy angels
in rejoicing that so many sinners were snatched, in such an unlikely
place and manner, out of the very jaws of the devil. This was the
beginning of the Tabernacle Society. Three hundred and fifty awakened
souls were received in one day; and, I believe, the number of notes
exceeded a thousand.</p>

<p>"The battle, that was begun on Monday, was not quite over till
Wednesday evening, though the scene of action was a little changed.</p>

<p>"Being strongly invited, and a pulpit being prepared for me by an
honest Quaker, a coal merchant, I ventured, on Tuesday evening, to
preach in Marylebone Fields, a place almost as much frequented by
boxers, gamesters, and such-like, as Moorfields. A vast congregation
was assembled, and, as soon as I got into the field-pulpit, their countenances
bespoke the enmity of their hearts against the preacher. I opened
with these words: 'I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the
power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.' I preached in
great jeopardy; for the pulpit being high, and the supports not well fixed
in the ground, it tottered every time I moved, and numbers of enemies
strove to push my friends against the supports, in order to throw me
down. But the Redeemer stayed my soul upon Himself, and I was not
much moved, except with compassion for those to whom I was delivering
my Master's message.</p>

<p>"Satan, however, did not like thus to be attacked in his strongholds,
and I narrowly escaped with my life; for, as I was passing from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
pulpit to the coach, I felt my hat and wig to be almost off. I turned
about, and observed a sword just touching my temples. A young rake,
as I afterwards found, was determined to stab me, but a gentleman, seeing
the sword thrust near me, struck it up with his cane, and so the destined
victim providentially escaped. Such an attempt excited abhorrence. The
enraged multitude seized the man, and had it not been for one of my
friends, who received him into his house, he must have undergone a
severe discipline.</p>

<p>"The next day, I renewed my attack in Moorfields; and, after the mob
found that pelting, noise, and threatenings would not do, one of the merry-andrews
got up into a tree, very near the pulpit, and shamefully exposed
his nakedness before all the people. Such a beastly action quite abashed
the serious part of my auditory; but hundreds, of another stamp, instead
of rising up to pull down the unhappy wretch, expressed their approbation
by repeated laughs. I must own, at first it gave me a shock. I thought
Satan had now almost undone himself; but, recovering my spirits, I
appealed to all, since now they had such a spectacle before them, whether
I had wronged human nature, in saying, after pious Bishop Hall, 'that
man, when left to himself, is half a devil and half a beast;' or, as the
great Mr. Law expressed himself, 'a motley mixture of the beast and
devil.'</p>

<p>"Silence and attention being thus gained, I concluded with a warm
exhortation; and closed our festival enterprises by reading fresh notes
that were put up, and by praising and blessing God, amidst thousands at
the Tabernacle, for what He had done for precious souls, and on account
of the deliverances He had wrought out for me and His people.</p>

<p>"I cannot help adding, that, several little boys and girls were fond
of sitting round me on the pulpit, while I preached, and handing to me
the people's notes. Though they were often struck with the eggs, dirt,
etc., thrown at me, they never once gave way; but, on the contrary, every
time I was struck, turned up their little weeping eyes, and seemed to wish
they could receive the blows for me."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a simple and strange story. Seldom do the
annals of the Christian Church present a more remarkable
example of the power of gospel truth. Here were assembled
thousands, "the devil's castaways," as Whitefield would have
called them,&mdash;the very scum of London's teeming population,
many of them clad in rags, and almost all of them
labelled with the marks of vice and wretchedness; and, yet,
even in such a congregation, hundreds become penitent, and
begin to call upon God for mercy. Even the wildest mob
only need "the truth as it is in Jesus" simply and faithfully
proclaimed, for there is always in that glorious truth a
something which meets the yearnings of the most degraded
soul. Whitefield's Easter-tide services, in the midst of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
Moorfields mobs, were not unworthy of the name he gave
them&mdash;"<em>a glorious Pentecost</em>."<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>Whitefield continued the services thus begun; and no
wonder. The following announcement was made in the
<cite>Weekly History</cite>, of May 8, 1742:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This evening, about six o'clock, the Rev. Mr. Whitefield purposes to
preach at Charles Square, by Hoxton.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> To-morrow, about five p.m., at
Kennington Common; and, on Tuesday next, about six p.m., at St. Marylebone
Fields. He preached, in Moorfields, every day in the holiday
week; some days twice, and some thrice. The auditories were very large
and attentive, and, for the most times, very quiet. Many souls have been
wrought upon during the last week's preaching, and several of them of the
most abandoned sort. The Society, in London, is in great order, and great
grace is among its members. For some time past, there have been
about twenty souls each week added to it. In about three weeks, Mr.
Whitefield purposes setting out for Scotland, with an intent to visit
Ireland also. He has been in London about two months, and has
preached twice, and sometimes thrice, every day."</p></blockquote>

<p>Whitefield embarked for Scotland on May 26, and
arrived in Edinburgh on the 3rd of June. During his eight
days' voyage, he employed himself, as usual when on shipboard,
in writing letters to his friends.</p>

<p>One of these was the Rev. Mr. Meriton, a clergyman in
the Isle of Man, who, ten months before, had become
acquainted with Wesley in London,<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> and who seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
spent the last years of his life chiefly in accompanying the
two Wesleys in their preaching excursions, and in assisting
them in the chapels they had built. He died in 1753. To
him Whitefield wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"On board the <em>Mary and Ann</em>, bound to Scotland, <em>May 26, 1742</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Rev. and dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I received your letter on Saturday last, and
felt great concern while perusing it. One thing especially pleased me.
I found that a report, I had lately heard concerning you, was false; for
I had been told, that the bishop, seeing your zeal, had, at last, ordered
the clergy to open the church doors for you, and that now you had done
with appearing openly in the defence of the glorious gospel. Blessed be
God! this is not true; though I find both you and your people have been
greatly discouraged. I see no way of extricating yourself, but by acting
up to the dictates of your own conscience, and leaving the consequences
to the great Head and King of the Church. Up then, and be doing; and
the Lord will be with you. If you cannot preach freely in the Isle of Man,
go whithersoever the Lord shall be pleased to lead you. Our commission
is very extensive: 'Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to
every creature.' We want labourers much in England. If our ascended
Saviour has given you popular gifts, and freedom and authority in speaking
without notes, you need not fear. He will assist you, and make you
a blessing to many souls.</p>

<p>"Your being a minister of the Established Church will be an advantage,
and your age also will give you yet more authority; but an unction from
the Holy One is the best qualification. I would, therefore, persuade you
to ask God, again and again, what He would have you to do. I am apt
to think, He will not restore to you the comforts of the Holy Ghost, until
you give up yourself simply to follow the dictates of His providence and
Spirit. Then, let men or devils say and do their worst. How can we
know God's power, unless we try it? Not that I would have you, dear
friend, do anything rashly. No: 'He that believeth doth not make
haste.'</p>

<p>"I wonder not that your brother's love is grown cold. It is hard for
one in his station, unless he be thoroughly inured to contempt, and will
give God leave to act in His own way, to withstand a whole body of lukewarm,
prejudiced, envious, malignant clergy. These have always been
the greatest opposers of true, vital religion. These were our Saviour's
most bitter enemies. These will be ours also, if we come forth in His
Spirit, and preach by His power. But, blessed be God! I can say, by
happy experience, our glorious Emmanuel will make us more than conquerors
over them all. He has continually fought my battles for me, and,
I am persuaded, will do so to the end."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was Whitefield's letter to this Methodist clergyman
in the Isle of Man. There can be little doubt, that it
greatly contributed towards securing for the Wesleys one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
the most brave-hearted of their clerical helpers, the Rev.
John Meriton. A good deal might be said concerning the
last ten years of his life; but this is not the place for it.</p>

<p>The following was (probably) written to John Bray, the
London Moravian, a former friend of the Wesleys and of
Whitefield, and who, at this particular time, was, like the
Rev. John Meriton, in doubt how to act.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> The London
Moravians were now in a state of considerable agitation, and
Bray, the brazier in Little Britain, London, as well as
Meriton, the clergyman, in the Isle of Man, seems to have
desired the benefit of his old friend's advice.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<em>May 27, 1742.</em>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Brother B.</span>,&mdash;Your letter was sweet to my heart. I will
now endeavour to answer it.</p>

<p>"I need not tell you I love you. God has often borne witness to our
fellowship, by giving us His presence. What has happened of late to
disunite, will, in the end, I am persuaded, only promote a closer union.
I feel my heart more and more disposed to love and honour all denominations
of believers. In all societies of Christians, under heaven, there must
necessarily be persons of a different standing in the school of Christ.
Those who are not solidly established in the love of God will fall too
much in love with the outward form of their particular church, be it what
it may; but as the love of God gets the ascendancy, the more they will
be like Him and His holy angels, and will, consequently, rejoice when
souls are brought to Jesus, whatever instruments may be made use of for
that purpose. I wish there was more confidence among us all; but I
see that none but the Spirit of God can outwardly unite us, and, therefore,
I have now given it up into the Redeemer's hand. Only this I pray,
that I may be one of the first, and not the last, in bringing back the
King. If I have, at any time, set improper bounds to the Spirit of God,
I desire to be very low and broken-hearted for it. I am sure it has not
been done willingly."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the same strain, Whitefield wrote to a minister at Leominster.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<em>May 27, 1742.</em>
</p>

<p>"If the Lord give us a true catholic spirit, free from sectarian zeal, we
shall do well. I am sorry to hear that there is so much narrowness
among some of the brethren in Wales. Brother Harris complains sadly
of it. I hope you will be kept free, and not fall into disputing about
baptism, or other non-essentials; for, I am persuaded, unless we all are
content to preach Christ, and to keep off from disputable things, wherein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
we differ, God will not bless us long. If we act otherwise, however we may
talk of a catholic spirit, we shall only bring people over to our own party,
and there fetter them."</p></blockquote>

<p>Another letter addressed to Howell, Harris, and to the
same effect, must suffice.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sig">
"<em>May 29, 1742.</em>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My very dear Brother</span>,&mdash;I am heartily sorry that such a narrow
spirit prevails in Wales. But what shall we say? The Redeemer's love
alone can unite and keep His flocks together. Disputing with bigots and
narrow-spirited people will not do. I intend, henceforth, to say less to
them, and pray more and more to our Lord for them. Blessed be God!
the partition wall is breaking down daily in some of our old friends' hearts
in London. I exhort all to go where they can profit most. O, my brother,
I find that nothing but the wisdom from above can teach us how to build
up souls.</p>

<p>"In London, we have public Societies twice a week, and a general
meeting for reading letters once a month. Our Lord has been much with
us. We seem to move on now in gospel dignity, and are terrible as an
army with banners. The Easter holidays were high days indeed. My
wife does not forget her friends in Wales. I expect great things in
Scotland. Adieu! Forget not to pray for your affectionate brother
pilgrim,</p>

<p class="sig">
"<span class="smcap">George Whitefield</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>It is evident, from these, and other letters, previously-inserted,
that Whitefield was a man of one business. He
was an evangelist at large. He discarded controversy. He
made no attempt to reform or to institute churches. His
sole object was "to testify the gospel of the grace of God,"
and to be useful in saving souls.</p>

<p>He arrived in Scotland on the 3rd of June, and here he
spent the next five months.</p>

from a large vault under the body of the church. In connection with the
church, and on the north side of it, stands St. Mary de Crypt School,
founded by "John Coke, Esq.," and his "Lady Joane Coke," about the
beginning of the sixteenth century. The master of the school had to be
chosen by the mayor, the recorder, and the senior aldermen of the city.
In 1712, two years before Whitefield's birth, a salary of £30 a year was
allowed to the head-master, and £16 a year to the usher. There was
also an annual allowance to several magistrates of the city for visiting the
school once a year; the mayor and four burgesses of Worcester were
made overseers, with an allowance of seven nobles for their charges; and
if the mayor and magistrates of Gloucester were guilty of neglect, they
had to forfeit £10 to the mayor and magistrates of Worcester. The school
also had two exhibitions for the maintenance of two scholars at Pembroke
College for eight years&mdash;the scholars to be elected by the mayor, the six
senior aldermen, and the head-master of the school. (" Ancient and
Present State of Gloucestershire," by Sir Robert Atkyns, 1712; and "The

beneficence. In the government of the College, over which he presided,
his vigilant attention was uniformly exerted to promote the important

the forgiveness of sins. Both are received at the same moment, and both
by the simple exercise of faith, or trust in Christ. The only interpretation
to be given to what Whitefield here relates is, that he now, at Gloucester,
was made <em>more thoroughly to understand</em> the great Scripture doctrine of
justification by faith only. The books from which he obtained this added
light are immediately specified.</p></div>

the time to Wesley, in Georgia:&mdash;
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,&mdash;At length, I have an opportunity of writing to my spiritual
father in Christ. I must first acquaint you that I am not yet returned
to Oxford. God hath opened to me a door into our Castle. The manner
of it was a little surprising. A youth broke out of Oxford prison, under
strong convictions of sin, and was apprehended here again. Mr. Broughton
heard of it, and bid me visit him. I went, and so have continued reading
to the prisoners ever since.
</p>
<p>
"God has been pleased, in some measure, to succeed my labours here;
and I hope, in time, we shall have a set of <em>altogether Christians</em>. The
Holy Spirit seems to be moving on the hearts of some young ladies.
One I observed quickened in an instant, who immediately set out for
Carmarthen, and, I believe, continues steadfast amidst a world of temptations.
Here are others, also, that seem to have some pangs of the new
birth. A young country lad came to me the other day, and brought me
a peck of apples, seven miles, on his back, as a token of gratitude for
benefits received, under God, by my hands. He has such a sense of
the Divine Presence, that he walks, for the most part, with his hat off.
</p>
<p>
"The devil, I find, has a particular spite against weekly communion;
yet I am in hopes we shall have the sacrament administered every Sunday
at the cathedral. It would have been mentioned to the bishop before
now, but Oxford friends advised to defer it till next summer.
</p>
<p>
"But now I have mentioned the bishop: alas! how should I tremble
to tell you how I have been continually disturbed with thoughts that I, a
worm, taken from a common public-house, should, ere I die, be one
myself! If you remember, sir, in my greatest affliction last Lent, it was
told me I should be a bishop, and therefore must be poor in spirit. That
thought came home upon me with so much force, and so many circumstances
have since occurred to favour the temptation, that I knew not
what to do. I communicated it to Mr. Broughton, and, thanks be to
God, it is somewhat abated. O heavenly Father! for Thy dear Son's
sake, keep me from climbing. Let me hate preferment! For Thy infinite
mercies' sake, let me love a low, contemptible life; and never
think to compound matters between the happiness of this world and the
next!
</p>
<p>

year 1679, and educated for the ministry in the Independent Academy at
Abergavenny. In 1718, he became the pastor of an Independent Church
in his native city. When Whitefield was a pupil in St. Mary de Crypt
School, he used frequently to attend Mr. Cole's ministry; and often
diverted his schoolfellows by a ridiculous relation of some of the good
man's pious anecdotes. On a schoolfellow admonishing him, and saying,
"George, one day you may be a preacher yourself," the youngster replied,
"If I am, I will not tell stories as old Cole does." A few years after
this, Whitefield preached in Cole's pulpit, and used several anecdotes
to illustrate the subject of his discourse. When the service was concluded,
Mr. Cole, good-humouredly, laid his hand on Whitefield's
shoulder, and said, "I find Whitefield can tell stories as well as old
Cole." Stimulated by Whitefield's example, Mr. Cole became a sort
of local itinerant, and, in the villages round about Gloucester, and
frequently out of doors, preached three or four times every week. He
was seized by death, whilst preaching at Nymphsfield, on August 4,
1742, and entered into the joy of his Lord in the sixty-fourth year of
his age.&mdash;<cite>Theological Magazine</cite>, 1803, p. 461.</p></div>

return to Oxford (Whitefield's Works, vol. i., p. 13). Charles Wesley,
on his return from Georgia, writes:&mdash;1736, December 6. I waited upon

increase both in zeal and number" (C. Wesley's Journal, vol. i., p. 56).
Sir Thomas Philips was one of the first members of the Society in Fetter
Lane ("Life and Times of Countess of Huntingdon," vol. i., p. 77). He
died a few weeks after Charles Wesley saw him. Hence, the following

Sir John Philips, Bart., of Picton Castle, Pembrokeshire; uncle to Sir

May 10, 1737, was accidentally discovered, in manuscript, more than
seventy years after his decease, and was first published, with a preface, in
1842. The text was, "Whom He justified, them He also glorified"
(Romans viii. 30). It is one of his best sermons. The only copy I have
ever seen was kindly lent to me by Mrs. A. J. Parker, of Camberwell,
daughter of the devout clergyman by whom it was revised and committed
to the press.</p></div>

I preached was upon 'Ye are justified;' and the next, 'Ye are glorified.'"

Church of England, who was trained at Eton College, and proceeded from
that institution, as one of its senior scholars, to King's College, Cambridge,
in the summer of 1694, where he graduated in arts as bachelor in 1698,
and as master in 1702. Being unable, from conscientious scruples, to take
the necessary oaths to the government, he felt himself obliged to resign
his Church preferment, and, engaging a house in College Street, Westminster,
took several boys, belonging to non-jurors, to board with him,
and be educated. Of course, like all the non-jurors of the age, he maintained
the doctrines of passive obedience; of the Divine institution of
hereditary succession to the throne; of the non-jurisdiction of the civil
magistrate in the Church, etc., etc. His wife was second-cousin to Sir
Isaac Newton; and his son, as is well known, became the principal
Moravian in England, and, later on in life, was a frequent and almost
familiar visitor of George III and his Queen Charlotte. For a time, a
close and affectionate intimacy existed between the Hutton family and
the Wesley brothers.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_117_117" id="Footnote_117_117"></a><a href="#FNanchor_117_117"><span class="label">[117]</span></a> James Habersham was born at Beverley, in 1712. He was married,
by Whitefield, to Mary Bolton, on December 26, 1740. He was the
manager of Bethesda till 1744, when he entered into business at Savannah.
He became President of Georgia in 1769; and died in 1775. In
all respects, he was a highly honourable man. (Belcher's Biography of
Whitefield.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_118_118" id="Footnote_118_118"></a><a href="#FNanchor_118_118"><span class="label">[118]</span></a> Under date of "Gravesend, January 3, 1738," Charles Wesley writes:
"I am here with G. Whitefield, my brothers Hall and Hutton, and a long
'etc.' of zealous friends. God has poured out His Spirit upon them, so that
the whole nation is in an uproar." (Life of C. Wesley, vol. i., p. 100.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_119_119" id="Footnote_119_119"></a><a href="#FNanchor_119_119"><span class="label">[119]</span></a> Whitefield read prayers and preached to his "red-coat parishioners,"
as he called them, twice every day, and "the very soldiers stood out to
say their catechism."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_120_120" id="Footnote_120_120"></a><a href="#FNanchor_120_120"><span class="label">[120]</span></a> It is a well-known fact, that, in early life, Wesley publicly maintained
that, in matters of importance, when the reasons on each side appeared
to be of equal weight, it was right to decide the question by casting
lots. (See Wesley's "Principles of a Methodist further explained," 1746.)
Strangely enough, this was the method he adopted to ascertain whether
Whitefield ought to abandon his mission to Georgia. In his letter to
Wesley, in 1740, during their Calvinistic quarrel, Whitefield wrote:
"The morning I sailed from Deal for Gibraltar, you arrived from Georgia.
Instead of giving me an opportunity to converse with you, though the
ship was not far from shore, you drew a lot, and immediately set forwards
to London. You left a letter behind you, in which were words to this
effect: 'When I saw God, by the wind which was carrying you out,
brought me in, I asked counsel of God. His answer you have enclosed.'
This was a piece of paper, in which were written these words: 'Let him
return to London.' Whitefield adds, he would 'never have published this
private transaction to the world,' if Wesley had not again used the lot to
determine whether he should 'preach and print' his memorable sermon
on 'Free Grace.'" (Whitefield's Works, vol. iv., p. 56.) It would not be
honest to omit this curious fact; but this is not the place to discuss its
propriety. Sortilege was one of the things which Wesley learned from
the devout Moravians.</p></div>

without his sanction, and which occasioned the publishing of Hutton's
edition, he writes under date of February 22: "We had an elegant
entertainment; but my thoughts were mostly employed in pitying the
unhappiness of great men who are in such a continual danger of having
their table become a snare to them." James Hutton left this out.
</p>
<p>
While on this subject, it may be added, that there are many remarks
and reflections in Whitefield's "Journal of a Voyage from London to
Savannah" which it is probable, with all his impulsiveness, he himself
would not have published. The facts of the case are these: 1. Whitefield
sent his Journal in manuscript for the private perusal of his friends.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_125_125" id="Footnote_125_125"></a><a href="#FNanchor_125_125"><span class="label">[125]</span></a> It might be added, that he also began to speak to his hearers, "one
by one," respecting the subjects on which he preached; and, to aid him
in this, he commenced, on March 12th, to write his "Observations on
Select Passages of Scripture turned into Catechetical Questions." These
were published in his collected works (vol. iv., pp. 345-373); but, though
carefully prepared, contain but little deserving further notice.</p></div>

Trustees of Georgia, and resided at Savannah. He afterwards published,
in two octavo volumes, "A Journal of the Proceedings in Georgia," from
which the following extracts are taken:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"1738. May 21. Mr. Whitefield officiated this day at the church,
and made a sermon very engaging to the most thronged congregation I
had ever seen there."
</p>
<p>
"May 28. Mr. Whitefield manifests great ability in the ministry, and
his sermons to-day were very moving."
</p>
<p>
"June 4. Mr. Whitefield's auditors increase daily, and the place of
worship is far too small to contain the people who seek his doctrine."
</p>
<p>
"June 18. Mr. Whitefield went on moving the people with his captivating
discourses. A child being brought to church to be baptized, he
performed that office by <i>sprinkling</i>, which gave great content to many
who had taken great distaste at the form of <em>dipping</em>, so strictly required
and so obstinately withstood by some parents that they have suffered
their children to go without the benefit of that sacrament, till a convenient
opportunity could be found of another minister to do that office."
</p>
<p>
"July 2. Mr. Whitefield gains more and more on the affections of the
people, by his labour and assiduity in the performance of divine offices;
to which an open and easy deportment, without show of austerity, or
singularity of behaviour in conversation, contribute not a little, and open
the way for him to inculcate good precepts, with greater success, among
his willing hearers." (Vol. i.)</p></div>

found to be almost penniless. Hence the following item in Whitefield's
account of money received for the poor of Georgia:&mdash;"1738. May 27.
Gave to Mr. Charles Delamotte, the catechist of Savannah, to pay his
passage, etc., to England, £15." In a foot note, however, Whitefield
states that this money was refunded by the Georgia trustees.</p></div>

present visit to Georgia:&mdash;"During my stay there, the weather was most
intensely hot, sometimes almost burning me through my shoes. Seeing
others do it, I determined to inure myself to hardiness by lying constantly
on the ground. Afterwards it became a hardship to lie upon a bed."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_135_135" id="Footnote_135_135"></a><a href="#FNanchor_135_135"><span class="label">[135]</span></a> One of these was John Martin Boltzius, whom Wesley, in the exercise
of his high-churchmanship, had refused to admit to the Lord's Table at
Savannah, because he had not been baptized,&mdash;that is, baptized by an
episcopally ordained clergyman. The Saltzburghers were deplorably poor.
In a letter to Dr. Isaac Watts, dated "Kensington, Nov. 30, 1737," the
Rev. F. M. Ziegenhagen, Court Chaplain to the Queen Consort of George II.,
says concerning them,&mdash;"In every respect they are suffering great
poverty and hardships. Their pious and indefatigable minister, the Rev.
Mr. Boltzius, acquaints me that any old rag thrown away in Europe is of
service to them: for instance, old shoes, stockings, shirts, or anything of
wearing apparel for men or women, grown people or children." (Milner's
"Life of Watts," p. 572.)</p></div>

Savannah, but, of Frederica. The reason why he settled at Savannah was
because, since Wesley's departure, the town had been without a minister;
and the reason why he deferred his residence at Frederica was because
there, there was not a church. (See Whitefield's Letter to Rev. Thomas
Church, in 1744.)</p></div>

custom, after reading the Second Lesson, to expound it, and, to make time
for this, he omitted the First Lesson and the Psalms for the day.

fellow. (Stephens's "Journal of the Proceedings in Georgia," vol. i.)

Wesley," vol. i., p. 157.)</p></div>

law into his own hands. A few weeks before, he had informed a man at
Savannah, that, for the future, he should refuse to "give him the cup at
the sacrament," because the man "denied the eternity of hell-torments."</p></div>

was so crowded that a great many stood without the doors and
under the windows to hear him, pleased with nothing more than the
assurances he gave of his intention to return to them as soon as possible."
He adds, that, when Whitefield left Savannah, he appointed Habersham,
the Savannah schoolmaster, to read the Church Service to the people
during his absence. Habersham did this for two months, when the Rev.
Mr. Norris came and took Whitefield's place. ("Journal of Proceedings in

he went to Hanover with George I., in the capacity of chaplain,
and was employed to teach Prince Frederick the English language.
During the same year, he was made Bishop of Bristol. Five years later,
he became Archbishop of Armagh, and Primate of Ireland. He expended
£30,000&mdash;an enormous sum in those days&mdash;in the augmentation of small
livings; erected and endowed hospitals, at Drogheda and Armagh, for
the reception of clergymen's widows; supported the sons of many poor
divines at the University; contributed greatly to the establishment of the
Protestant charter schools; and, during a scarcity of food, in 1740,
provided, at his own expense, two meals a day for upwards of two thousand
five hundred distressed persons. He died four years after his courteous
kindness to Whitefield.</p></div>

Byrom, and his brother Josiah, as well as myself, that you had better
forbear publishing, at least for a time, till your difficulties are blown over.

For a season, Whitefield's irregularities somewhat tried the patience of
Bishop Benson; and it is related that, in an excited conversation with
the Countess of Huntingdon, he "bitterly lamented" that he had ordained
his youthful protégé. The countess replied, "Mark my words: when
you come upon your dying bed, that will be one of the few ordinations
you will reflect upon with complacence." It deserves remark, that Bishop
Benson, on his dying bed, sent ten guineas to Whitefield, as a token of
his favour and approbation, and begged to be remembered by him in his
prayers.</p></div>

writes:&mdash;"Mr. Whitefield has been taking a progress through these parts
to make a collection for a house in Georgia for orphans and such of the
natives' children as they will part with to learn our language and religion.
He came hither to see me, and we talked about your brothers. I told
him, I did not like their way of living, and wished them in some place of
their own, wherein they might regularly preach. He replied, 'I could not
conceive the good they did in London; that the greatest part of our clergy
were asleep; and that there never was a greater need of itinerant preachers
than now.' I then asked Mr. Whitefield if my sons were not making some
innovations in the Church, which I much feared. He assured me they
were so far from it, that they endeavoured all they could to reconcile
Dissenters to our communion. His stay was short, so I could not talk
with him so much as I desired. He seems to be a very good man, and
one who truly desires the salvation of mankind. God grant that the
wisdom of the serpent may be joined to the innocence of the dove!"

for debt, on January 10, 1743, and put into Newgate prison, Bristol, where
he remained until his death on the 31st of July next ensuing. Dr. Johnson
writes: "He was treated by Mr. Dagge, the keeper of the prison, with
great humanity; was supported by him at his own table without any
certainty of recompence; had a room to himself, to which he could at any
time retire from all disturbance; was allowed to stand at the door of the
prison, and was sometimes taken out into the fields; so that he suffered
fewer hardships in prison than he had been accustomed to undergo in the
greatest part of his life. During the whole time of his imprisonment, the
keeper continued to treat him with the utmost tenderness and civility.
Virtue is undoubtedly most laudable in that state which makes it most
difficult, and therefore the humanity of a gaoler certainly deserves this
public attestation; and the man whose heart has not been hardened by
such an employment may be justly proposed as a pattern of benevolence.
If an inscription was once engraved 'to the honest toll-gatherer,'
less honours ought not to be paid 'to the tender gaoler.'" It ought to be
added, to the honour of Dagge, Whitefield's friend and admirer, that
he defrayed the expense of burying Savage in the churchyard of
St. Peter's.</p></div>

"I thought it might be doing service to my Creator, who had a mountain
for His pulpit, and the heavens for His sounding-board; and who, when
His gospel was refused by the Jews, sent His servants into the highways
and hedges." It may also be added here, as an interesting fact, that
Whitefield's first sermon at Kingswood was the means under God of the
conversion of Thomas Maxfield, generally, but incorrectly, said to have
been the first layman whom Wesley authorised to preach. (Vindication of
Rev. Mr. Maxfield's Conduct, 1767, p. 3.)</p></div>

of Kilredin, and educated in the Grammar-school at Camarthen, he
was ordained a deacon in 1708, and a priest in 1709, by the learned
Bishop Bull. He was preferred to the Rectory of Llandowror by Sir
John Philips of Picton Castle. At the request of the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, he consented to go as a
missionary among the Indians; but, for some unknown reason, this
arrangement was set aside. Divinity was the grand study of Mr. Jones's
life. He was well versed in the writings of the most eminent English and
foreign divines. His sermons were solid, lively, striking, and judicious.
His voice was musical, his delivery agreeable, his action proper. As a
preacher, he soon became famous, and great multitudes flocked to hear
him wherever he went. Invitations to preach in other churches besides
his own were frequent; and, in many instances, the crowds were such that
he was obliged to preach in the churchyards. On some of these occasions,
his sermons occupied three hours in delivery. He instituted, and for
twenty-four years maintained by subscriptions, the circulating Welsh Free
Schools, the object of which was to teach the poor to read their native
language, and to instruct them in the principles of the Christian religion.
At the time of his decease, the number of his schools was more than 3,000,
and of their scholars 158,000, some of them sixty years old. Principally
by his efforts, the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge was induced
to print two editions of the Welsh Bible, of 15,000 copies each, which
were sold as cheap as possible, for the benefit of the poor in Wales. He
was also himself the author of at least a dozen different publications. He
died on the 8th of April, 1761, in the seventy-eighth year of his age, and
was interred at his own parish church of Llandowror.&mdash;<cite>Gospel Magazine</cite>,

laborious and successful, especially among the poor prisoners in Newgate,
Bristol, and among the rude colliers of Kingswood. On Saturday, the
18th inst., he preached at Hannam Mount to five or six thousand persons,
and in the evening removed to the Common, about half a mile farther,
where three mounts and the plains around were crowded with so great a
multitude of coaches, foot and horsemen, that they covered three acres,
and were computed at twenty thousand people; and, at both places, he
collected £14 10s. for the Orphan House of Georgia."</p></div>

his power, by his preaching, to detain five or six thousand of the vulgar
from their labour, what a loss in a little time may this bring to the public!
For my part, I shall expect to hear of a prodigious rise in the price of coals

"On Saturday last, the Rev. Mr. Whitefield, being denied the use of a
pulpit, preached to a prodigious concourse of people on a tombstone, in
Islington churchyard. Last Sunday morning, he did the same from the
wall near Bedlam; and, in the afternoon, near the gallows on Kennington
Common, to a vast number of people." <cite>Read's Weekly Journal</cite>, of the
same date, says: "The followers of Parson Whitefield have done a vast
deal of damage to the tombs and gravestones in Islington churchyard."
It also adds that the question of Whitefield's exclusion from the pulpit of
Islington Church was decided by a committee of ten; five chosen by Mr.
Stonehouse, the vicar, and five by the parish vestry. Their decision was
unanimous.</p></div>

was told "the devil was in them all;" that is, in himself, Whitefield, and
the vicar. Mr. Stonehouse waited upon the bishop; but had to leave him
"close, shut up, and sour." In reference to Whitefield, Charles Wesley
writes: "April 25. I heard G. Whitefield, very powerful, at Fetter Lane.
April 27. I heard G. Whitefield in Islington churchyard. The numerous

article, of two pages, probably written by Dr. Trapp himself. The writer
says it would be foolish to answer every "half-witted murderer of paper;"
and therefore Trapp refuses to reply to "Seagrave's Answer." The
present article, however, would serve in lieu of a mere formal rejoinder.
Two sentences were as follows:&mdash;Seagrave "abuses the clergy with much
rudeness and insolence; and, at the same time, pays his compliments to
the Dissenters, as if the learning and orthodoxy of the nation rested
chiefly, nay, almost only, in them." Again: "Pluralities are the stale
topic of every ignorant creature who hates the Church. Pluralities are
<em>necessary</em> in many cases, <em>highly expedient</em> in others; nor could the
Church well subsist without them."</p></div>

says, "he has lately been thrust out of the synagogues for speaking
of justification by faith, and the new birth, and has commenced a field-preacher.
Once he was shut in prison for a short time; but thousands
flock to hear him, and God blesses him more and more. I believe we are
the first professed ministers of the Church of England, who, without cause,
are excluded from every pulpit." A year afterwards, Mr. Rogers joined
Ingham, in Yorkshire; and, finally, became a Moravian. (See "The

"an innumerable multitude." <cite>The Craftsman</cite>, of June 9, says,
On Sunday night, Mr. Whitefield preached his farewell sermon at Kennington
Common, and collected £34 5s. for the Orphan House in
Georgia. The total sum collected by him for several charities is as follows:&mdash;For
the Orphan House, £966; for the poor in general, £150; for
erecting a church for the Saltzburghers, £77; total, £1193.</p></div>

the Wesleys; and a more detailed account of him may be given hereafter.
At present, suffice it to say, that, nine days after this service at Bexley
Church, the Archbishop of Canterbury expressly forbad Mr. Piers to allow
either Whitefield or the Wesleys to preach in his church again. Mr. Piers
obeyed the <em>letter</em> of this injunction&mdash;that is, his <em>pulpit</em> was closed against
them; but not his <em>reading desk</em>, nor his <em>communion place</em>.</p></div>

thousand." It is only fair to say, that Whitefield's estimates might be too
high. In the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for August, 1739, there appeared a
letter, signed "Thoninonca," stating that the writer was present when
Whitefield preached in Moorfields on July 29, and that, before the
audience was dismissed, he "made several marks where the outermost of
them stood; and, the next morning, he found the distance of the farthest
mark from the rostrum to be thirty-two yards, and that of the nearest to
it twenty-eight." He then calculates "the space taken up by the standing
congregation to be 2827 yards;" and adds, "in a square yard, nine persons
may easily stand, and therefore 2827 square yards must contain 25,443
people." To this the editor appended a note: "Soldiers, in close order,
stand but four in a square yard, at which rule, the circle will contain but
11,338."</p></div>

two collections for Kingswood School, namely, one at Bristol on July 13th,
and the other at Moorfields on July 29th. To these, however, must be
added the following. Collections, on July 22, at Moorfields, £24 17s.,
and at Kennington Common, £15 15s. 6d. And besides the one already
mentioned as being made at Moorfields on July 29, another, on the same
day at Kennington Common, amounting to £20, and another of nearly
£15, at Blackheath, on August 12.</p></div>

the doctrines of election and of sinless perfection are not mentioned. In

sermons preached by Whitefield prior to his second visit to America.</p></div>

"November 12, 1739," Wesley writes: "A young gentleman overtook
me on the road from Wycombe to Oxford, and, after a while, asked me if
I had seen Whitefield's Journals? I told him I had. 'And what do you
think of them?' said he. 'Don't you think they are d&mdash;n'd cant, enthusiasm,
from end to end? I think so.' I asked him, 'Why do you think
so?' He replied, 'Why, he talks so much about joy and stuff, and inward
feelings. As I hope to be saved, I cannot tell what to make of it.'"</p></div>

and the falsehoods used to injure him, the following is extracted from
<cite>Read's Weekly Journal</cite>, of October 20, 1739:&mdash;"Edinburgh, October 9.
It is said that the Rev. Mr. Whitefield, whose savoury Journals used to be
quoted with applause by our Scot seceders, has of late addressed himself
to one of these champions, in a letter which contains his opinions of their
principles; and, in the strongest terms, condemns them as the authors
of a detestable schism, endeavours to persuade them to return to their
duty, and to leave off their divisive courses. This letter has given great
offence; and Mr. Whitefield, from being a reformer, a saint, and a
shining light, is degenerated, in their discourses, into one whose heart
is corrupted, who will not lift up a testimony against the corruptions of
the Church: in short, as one (oh horrid!) who will not rebel against an
authority which he swore to maintain."</p></div>

published in 1756, Whitefield states: "Joseph Periam married one of the
Orphan-house mistresses. After a few years, both died; and I have now
two of their sons in the Orphan House, who are very promising boys."</p></div>

Strahan, and sold at Mr. James Hutton's," (8vo. 28 pp.,) with the additional
statement on the title-page, that it was "published for the benefit
of the school lately erected among the colliers in Kingswood, near Bristol."
This edition had also the following characteristic motto prefixed, taken
from the works of St. Hilary:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"One thing I forewarn you of&mdash;beware of Antichrist; for it is evil to
be taken, as you are, with the love of stone walls; it is evil to have a
veneration for the church of God, as you have, in houses and edifices;
it is evil to cry, as you do, Peace, peace, under these: for is there any
doubt to be made, whether Antichrist will fix his seat in these? To
me, mountains, and forests, and fens, and prisons, and pits, are the safer
places; for in these it was that the prophets&mdash;either waiting for, or being
actually overwhelmed with, the Spirit of God&mdash;prophesied, or spake as
they were moved by the Holy Ghost."</p></div>

where, and through the Jerseys and at New York, he preached daily to
incredible multitudes with great eloquence and zeal. America is like to

about June next; and our town and country stand ready to receive him

doctrine and practice, but, on account of some irregularity in his being
called to the ministry, the Presbytery refused to recognise him. He,
accordingly, began to preach in barns and other unconsecrated places.
In the spring of 1739, numbers of persons, in Lawrence, Hopewell, and
Amwell, three contiguous towns in New Jersey, were powerfully affected
by his preaching, and their convictions of sin were attended with great
horror, trembling, and weeping. John Rowland was an irregular revivalist,
exceedingly effective and useful. (Hodge's "History of the Presbyterian
Church in the United States.")</p></div>

"and was accompanied to Chester by about one hundred and
fifty horse, and preached there to about seven thousand people. On
Friday, he preached twice at Wilmington, to about five thousand; on
Saturday, at Newcastle, to about two thousand five hundred; and the
same evening, at Christiana Bridge, to about three thousand; on Sunday,
at Whiteclay Creek, he preached twice, resting about half an hour

strange, but are sufficiently explained by the following extract from a letter
which Whitefield wrote to Gilbert Tennent: "In these parts, Satan seems
to lead people captive at his will. The distance of the plantations prevents
people assembling together. Here are no great towns, as in other
provinces, and the commonalty is made up of negroes and convicts; and
if they pretend to serve God, their masters, Pharaoh-like, cry out, 'Ye are

in 1673. At the age of twenty-two, he embarked for London, and was
taken prisoner by a French privateer. On being released, he proceeded to
England, where he became acquainted with Howe, Calamy, Burkitt, and
other ministers of distinction. In 1699, he returned to Boston, and was
appointed the first minister of the church in Brattle Street, where he continued
to officiate until his death in 1747. He was neither a Presbyterian
nor an Independent, but something between the two. His learning, talents,
piety, and usefulness secured him universal respect; and he certainly was
one of the most distinguished ministers in New England.</p></div>

Smith, Independent minister, on March 26, defended him in a sermon
founded upon the text, "I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew
my opinion." First of all, Mr. Smith dwells on the doctrines which Whitefield
everywhere preached; namely, original sin, justification by faith alone,
and the new birth. He then proceeds to give his opinion of Whitefield
himself. He says: "He is certainly a finished preacher, and a great master
of pulpit oratory, while a noble negligence runs through his style. How is
his tongue like the pen of a ready writer! With what a flow of words did
he speak to us upon the great concerns of our souls! In what a flaming
light did he set eternity before us! How did he move our passions with
the constraining love of Christ! The awe, the silence, the attention which
sat upon the face of so great an audience, was an argument how he could
reign over all their powers. So charmed were the people with his manner
of address, that they shut up their shops, forgot their secular business,
and laid aside their schemes for the world; and the oftener he preached,
the keener edge he seemed to put upon their desires of hearing him again.
How bold and courageous did he look! He was no flatterer, would not
suffer men to settle upon their lees, and did not prophesy smooth things.
The politest, the most modish of our vices, the most fashionable of our
entertainments, he struck at, regardless of every one's presence but His
in whose name he spake. How rich has he been in all good works!
What an eminent pattern of piety towards God! How holy and unblameable
in all conversation and godliness! He affects no party, nor sets
himself at the head of any. He is always careful to time his Sabbath discourses,
so as not to interfere with the stated hours of worship in that
Church of which he is a professed member and minister; because, as he
told us, he would not tempt away hearers from their proper and respective
pastors. He appears to me a man full of the Holy Ghost and of faith.
Though his prayers in this pulpit were all extempore, yet how copious,
how ardent, with what compass of thought! He prays in public with that
spirit, variety, and fluency which could only be expected from a man who
was no stranger to the sacred duty in private. For charity, as it consists
in compassion and acts of beneficence, we have few men like-minded.
Strolling and vagabond orphans, poor and helpless, without purse and
without a friend, he seeks out, picks up, and adopts into his family. He
is now building a house, and laying the best foundation for their support
and religious instruction, without any visible fund; encouraged to go on
in faith, from the shining example of the great professor in Germany, who
began a like pious work with almost nothing, and raised it to such perfection
as is the wonder of all who hear it."

Such was the public testimony of the Independent minister at Charleston,
delivered at the time when the clergyman of the Church of England
was doing his utmost to bring young Whitefield into disrepute. His
chapel, in which Whitefield preached, and where he collected upwards of
£70 sterling for the Orphanage, was then called the "White Meetinghouse,"
and occupied the site of the present circular church. ("Methodism
in Charleston," p. 20.)</p></div>

detestation."</p></div>

the <cite>Daily Advertiser</cite> of July 2nd, 1740. It is an immensely long production,
and really not worth quoting. He says he had looked over "the
index and general titles" of the book, and could not find "the word
Regeneration so much as once mentioned." The letter is chiefly theological;
but Whitefield would have been better employed in preaching,
than in writing this verbose epistle. It did no credit either to his head or
heart, and was not inserted in his collected works in 1771.</p></div>

Early in life, Whitefield was preaching in a field. A drummer, who
happened to be present, rudely beat his drum to drown the preacher's
voice. Whitefield spoke very loud, but failed to make himself heard.
"Friend," cried he, "you and I serve the two greatest masters existing:
you beat up for volunteers for King George; I for the Lord Jesus. In
God's name, let us not interrupt each other. The world is wide enough
for both; and we may get recruits in abundance." The drummer went
away in great good humour, and left Whitefield in full possession of the
field.</p></div>

inconvenient to assemble in the open air, subject to its inclemencies,
the building of a house was proposed. Sufficient sums were soon
received to procure the ground and erect the building, which was a
hundred feet long, and seventy broad. Both house and ground were
vested in trustees, expressly for the use of <em>any preacher of any religious
persuasion</em>, who might desire to say something to the people of
Philadelphia. The design of the building not being to accommodate any
particular sect, but the inhabitants in general, it follows, that even if the
Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach Mahomedanism
to us, he would find a pulpit at his service." (Memoirs of Benjamin

he came to Philadelphia, and was apprenticed to a merchant. Two years
after Whitfield's present visit, he abandoned business, and became the
master of the Quakers' English school of Philadelphia; and this honourable,
though not lucrative, office he continued to fulfil, with little intermission,
until his death, in 1784. By his unwearied exertions, he was the
means of first attracting public attention to the enormities of slavery.
Hundreds of negroes followed him to his grave.</p></div>

was, practically, a Dissenter. Thomas Olivers, who knew him well, observes:
"That Mr. Whitefield was strongly prejudiced in favour of the Dissenters,
as Dissenters, is notorious. I myself have, perhaps on forty occasions,
both at my own house and elsewhere, heard him speak, with great
partiality, of our English Dissenters in general&mdash;particularly of the
Puritans of old, and also of our modern Presbyterians, Independents, and
Baptists. The whole world knows how uncommonly fond he was of the
Scotch Presbyterians, and of the American Independents; while the
Episcopalians, in both these countries, were almost entirely overlooked by
him." (Olivers' "Rod for a Reviler," 1777, p. 22.)</p></div>

shade of the same tree Washington first drew his sword in the cause of
the revolution, on taking the command of the American army. From
this circumstance, the tree was ever afterwards called "Washington's
Elm." It may also be added, that, one of the students, converted by
Whitefield's sermon, on this occasion, was Daniel Emerson, who was
ordained, in 1743, first minister of Hollis, New Hampshire, the pastorate
of which place he retained until his death in 1801. "He was truly a son
of thunder, a flaming light; and was almost incessantly engaged in
preaching, attending funerals, etc., far and wide. He was made the
means of extensive revivals of religion." (Belcher's "Biography of
Whitefield.")</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_375_375" id="Footnote_375_375"></a><a href="#FNanchor_375_375"><span class="label">[375]</span></a> The governor was the Honourable Jonathan Belcher, a native of
Massachusetts, where his father was a wealthy merchant. After an
academical education in his own country, he came to Europe, was twice
at Hanover, and was introduced to the Court there when the Princess
Sophia was the presumptive heiress to the British crown. The gracefulness
of his person, his talents, and property, procured him considerable
notice. In 1730, he was appointed Governor of New England, and continued
in that office until the year 1740, the time of Whitefield's visit. He
lived in great state, was hospitable, fond of splendid equipages, and of an
aspiring turn of mind. In 1741, he became Governor of the New Jerseys,
and was succeeded in New England by Governor Shirley. To enable the
reader to estimate the value of some of Whitefield's collections for the
orphans, it may be added that, when Belcher left New England, the
currency was so much depreciated, that £100 sterling was equal to £550
Massachusetts currency. Belcher, to the end of his life, was one of
Whitefield's most faithful friends. (Milner's "Life of Dr. Watts," and
Johnston's "History of Bristol and Bremen.")</p></div>

Hollis Street, Boston. From 1733 to the revolution in 1776, he continued
to discharge his ministerial functions with great acceptance; but, because
he then sympathised with the royalists rather than with the revolutionists,
he was brought to a public trial, and was denounced as a person inimical
to America. After this, he was not connected with any church. His
literary merits introduced him to some of the most distinguished men in
England, including Pope and Watts. He died in 1788, aged 82.</p></div>

charging him with not preaching the gospel, because he did not preach

and, accordingly, he preached and printed his sermon on "Free Grace."</p></div>

at Charleston, he was sent on parole, in 1781, to Philadelphia, where he

was John Porter, pastor at Bridgewater, who writes: "I knew nothing
rightly of my sin and danger, of my need of a Saviour, of the way of salvation
by Him; neither was I established in the doctrines of grace, till I
heard that man of God, Mr. Whitefield, at Boston." Six months after
this, a revival took place at Bridgewater, and a large number of the population
were converted. Another minister similarly benefited was the Rev.
Jonathan Parsons, of the West Parish of Lyme, where, in the spring of
1741, occurred a revival quite as wonderful as that at Bridgewater. At
Portsmouth, where Whitefield preached on October 3, 1740, God's work
was remarkably revived some months afterwards. In fact, as is well
known, for two or three years subsequent to Whitefield's visit, nearly the
whole of New England became another "valley of vision," where "the
breath from the four winds" breathed, and, as the newly quickened
prophets "prophesied," in thousands of instances, "dry bones" were
made to live. It would be absurd to attribute the <em>whole</em> of this to Whitefield's
visit; but there cannot be a doubt that, in an indirect way, by the
impressions he made on ministers and churches, his usefulness was great.

to have been "occasioned by the late powerful and awakening preaching

Colonel Brattle, a representative of Cambridge in the general court,
published two letters in the <cite>Boston Gazette</cite>, for April 20, and June 29,
1741; in which he vindicated the college at Cambridge against Whitefield's
strictures upon it, but, at the same time, admitted that, "by the
preaching of Whitefield and Tennent, the students <em>in general</em> had been
deeply affected, and their enquiry now was, 'What shall we do to be
saved?' These gentlemen," continues the colonel, "have planted, Mr.
Appleton has watered; but, after all, it was God who gave the increase."
Brattle adds, that "the overseers of the college thought it proper to set
apart the forenoon of June 12, 1741, humbly to bless and praise the God
of all grace for His abundant mercy to that Society."</p></div>

unfriendly, writer, and must be taken <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum grano salis</i>:&mdash;When Whitefield
came to America, Barber "esteemed him a wonderfully holy man,"
and believed he would "be an eminent promoter of a glorious revival of
vital religion through the whole land." Barber, at once, set to work,
"and spent about a week in going from house to house through all the
parish of Oyster-Ponds, solemnly warning the people, and exhorting them
to repent, for the kingdom of heaven was at hand. And this he did as
one <em>extraordinarily instructed</em> and <em>commissioned</em> for that purpose." He
then went through all the parishes of Southold, where Mr. Davenport was
pastor; and, "as he counted his mission somewhat like that of our Lord's
disciples, who were sent before Him into every city, whither He Himself
would come, he <em>took no money with him</em>, neither <em>change of apparel</em>, nor
<em>shoes</em>, but was shod with <em>boots</em>; and, as he passed along, he publicly
declared that he "<em>had laid aside all study</em> and <em>forethought</em> of what he
should deliver in his <em>public speeches</em> to the people, and depended wholly
on the <em>immediate direction of the Holy Ghost</em>." He next proceeded to
<em>Oldmans</em>, where "he abode some months, and led an inactive and idle
life, till he was grown very <em>fat</em> and <em>ragged</em>, alleging, in his justification,
that he had received <em>no direction from the Spirit to remove thence</em>, and
must remain there so long as <em>the cloud abode upon the tabernacle</em>." At
length, "he went to Rhode Island to see Mr. Whitefield, and joined himself
to him." ("Seasonable Thoughts on the State of Religion in New
England." By Charles Chauncy, D.D., 1743, pp. 183-189.)</p></div>

his character was published by an old friend, still resident in Savannah,
to the following effect: "Until within a few years past, Mr. Whitefield
has been constantly loaded with debt on account of his Orphan House,
although he was at the same time traduced as a cheat, who, under the
specious pretence of promoting a charitable institution, was amassing
great wealth to himself. When he was the stated minister of this parish,
the then inhabitants of Savannah, and Highgate, and Hampstead, together
with the Saltzburghers of Ebenezer, and the people of Darien and
Frederica, all partook of his bounty to a very large amount, while he
almost denied himself the necessaries of life. He constantly performed
Divine service publicly very early every morning, and at the close of the
day every evening, when he always expounded part of the first or second
lesson. Every Sunday, he administered the holy communion, and had
public service four times during the day. His congregations were very
numerous; for, though there were many Dissenters in the parish, there
were few absenters. He also made it his daily practice to visit in rotation
from house to house, without any regard to religious denominations or
party distinctions." (<cite>Gospel Magazine</cite>, 1771, pp. 77-80.) There is
nothing new in this, and yet it is valuable as the testimony of a gentleman
who was one of Whitefield's parishioners at Savannah, and who says he
was well acquainted with Whitefield's proceedings.</p></div>

and sent twenty closely written sheets, filled with his predictions, to the
Speaker of the South Carolina House of Assembly. It was, also,
rumoured that he was encamped in the wilderness, and was gathering
together all sorts of people&mdash;especially negroes; and that he had procured
firearms, for some secret and dangerous purpose. Warrants were issued
for his apprehension; but, before they could be served, he discovered his
delusion, confessed his errors, and begged for pardon. The man was not
traitorous, but mad. In order to ascertain whether the "invisible spirit,"
with whom he imagined he had held converse, was an angel or the devil,
he nearly drowned himself. A long account of the whole affair was
ordered to be printed by the House of Assembly, on March 3, 1742; and
was published in the Boston <cite>Postboy</cite>, of May 3, 1742.</p></div>

London, he committed the boy to the care of the Moravians, who undertook
to provide for him until he should be of the age of twenty-one. He
was sent to Germany. When Whitefield was returning to America, in
1744, he wished to take the boy back to his mother, in Carolina. The
Moravians objected; Whitefield had to submit; and, in the same year,
the boy was baptized at Lindheim, and was named Andrew. ("Memoirs of

Rowland Hill taunted Wesley by stating that he cast "lots for his creed."
Thomas Olivers, the confidential friend of Wesley, in his "Rod for a
Reviler," replied to this as follows:&mdash;"It is hard not to believe that the
relaters of this story are totally void of veracity, honour, and conscience.
The well-known fact is neither more nor less than this. When Mr.
Whitefield, by embracing and preaching Calvinism, turned aside from
the original doctrines of Methodism, it was a doubt with Mr. Wesley,
not whether he should <em>believe</em> Calvinism, but whether he should
<em>preach and print</em> against it. What made this a matter of doubt was,
if he did expressly preach and print against it, he would oppose Mr.
Whitefield, whom he dearly loved. On the other hand, if he did not
preach and print against it, Mr. Whitefield's great influence would draw
vast multitudes into his mistake. In this strait, it is true, he cast a lot,
which came up to this effect, 'As thou hast long believed Calvinism to
be a delusion, regardless of friends and enemies, preach and print against
it.' Now, will good men, will men of honour, will men who make
the smallest pretence to integrity, conscience, truth, justice, or anything
else that is good, call this 'Casting lots for his creed'?" ("A Rod for a
Reviler." London, 1777, pp. 9, 10.)</p></div>

a small folio of four pages; and the first number appears to have been
issued on April 11, 1741, exactly a month after Whitefield's arrival from
America. In No. 4, the editor says: "The Rev. Mr. Whitefield intends
to supply me with fresh matter every week." The periodical was continued
weekly until November 13, 1742, when No. 84 was issued, to which the
editor appended the following note: "Now that this first volume is
finished, we purpose to begin the next in a more commodious manner. It
is to be printed in a neat pocket volume, and to be delivered (every week,
as it was at the first,) at the Tabernacle, and at people's houses, at the

Wesley's meeting-houses, was not repeated. At the time of Whitefield's
death, Wesley, in a letter published in Lloyd's <cite>Evening Post</cite>, remarked:
"Mr. Whitefield did not everywhere preach the eternal covenant and
absolute predestination. I never heard him utter a sentence on one or the
other. Yea, all the times he preached in West-street chapel, and in our
other chapels throughout England, he did not preach these doctrines at
all, no, not in a single paragraph." (Wesley's Works, vol. xiii., p. 378.)</p></div>

them both, but, for a while, thought of joining with neither, because I
seemed to think there were extremes on both sides. However, afterwards,
I had by much the greatest satisfaction on Mr. Whitefield's side, with
whom I openly joined at the beginning of May, 1741. At which time, I

Another pamphlet published against Whitefield was the following: "A
Letter, from a Gentleman in the Country to his Friend in Edinburgh,
concerning Mr. Wh&mdash;f&mdash;d: wherein his Mission, Doctrine, and Character
are impartially enquired into and examined. Edinburgh, 1741." (31 pp.)
The writer wants to know Whitefield's authority for preaching in Scotland,
and asks, "Was there really a necessity for sending down a young
man, meanly educated, to teach the Scottish clergy their duty, and direct
them to more accuracy, life, and zeal in the discharge of the several parts
of their function?" He further asks, "Shall I believe, what is told me,
that, though Mr. Whitefield has declared himself a member of the Church
of England, yet, he has not so much as once, since he came to Scotland,
begun or concluded his worship with the Lord's Prayer or the Doxology?"
The general conclusion of the writer is, that Whitefield "has more of
craziness than grace; and that this son of Levi takes far too much upon
him."</p></div>

1741," as follows: "Numbers of all ranks, all denominations, and all
characters, come to hear him, though his sermons abound with those
truths which would be unwelcome from the mouths of others. Three
hours before noon he appoints for people under distress to converse with
him." (Gillies' "Memoirs of Whitefield.")</p></div>

November 7, the Rev. Mr. Whitefield arrived at Abergavenny, where he
preached several times, as also at Trevecca, Erwood, Pontypool, Waterford,
etc. On Saturday last, he came to Bristol, where he has continued to
preach twice every day, to crowded auditories; and visible success attends
his labours."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_498_498" id="Footnote_498_498"></a><a href="#FNanchor_498_498"><span class="label">[498]</span></a> He had a serious encounter with Joseph Humphreys and Thomas
Bissicks, about the time he thus wrote to Whitefield. Wesley, in reference
to this dispute, observes, "H. Harris kept them at bay till about one
o'clock in the morning. I then left them and Capt. T&mdash;&mdash; together.
About three, they left off just where they began." (Wesley's Works, vol. i.,
p. 321.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_499_499" id="Footnote_499_499"></a><a href="#FNanchor_499_499"><span class="label">[499]</span></a> Probably this interview with Wesley was the same as that of which
Wesley gives an account, in his Journal, under the date of October, 1741.
He writes: "Howell Harris came to me. He said, as to the decree of
reprobation, he renounced and utterly abhorred it. And as to the not
falling from grace, 1. He believed that it ought not to be mentioned to
the unjustified, or to any that were slack or careless, much less that lived
in sin. 2. He did himself believe it was possible for one to fall away, who
had been 'enlightened' with some knowledge of God, who had 'tasted
of the heavenly gift, and had been made partaker of the Holy Ghost;'
and wished we could all agree to keep close, in the controverted points,
to the very words of Holy Writ. 3. That he accounted no man so justified
as not to fall, till he had a thorough, abiding hatred of all sin, and a
continual hunger and thirst after all righteousness. Blessed be thou of
the Lord, thou man of peace! Still follow after peace and holiness."

Whitefield and himself apart. Within three weeks after this, Wesley
writes again: "1742, May 12. I waited on the Archbishop of Canterbury,
with Mr. Whitefield, and again on Friday; as also on the Bishop of
London. I trust, if we should be called to appear before princes, we
should not be ashamed." (Wesley's Journal.)</p></div>

mistake. In 1742, Easter Sunday fell on April 18th; and Whit-Sunday,
on June 6th, nearly a month after the date of this letter.</p></div>

as recently as 1839. (See "Services at the Centenary of Whitefield's
Apostolic Labours, 1839," p. 22.) It so happens, however, that,
in this very year 1876, another pulpit, or perhaps the same, is on view in
the great Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia. The following is taken
from the London <cite>Watchman and Wesleyan Advertiser</cite>, of June 14,
1876: "The portable pulpit of George Whitefield, which belongs to the
American Tract Society, is on view at the Centennial Exhibition. It is
made of pine wood, and is so contrived that it can be easily taken apart
and put together. The great preacher delivered more than two thousand
sermons from this pulpit in the fields of England, Wales, and America;
and he once remarked that the gospel had been preached from it to
more than ten millions of people."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_513_513" id="Footnote_513_513"></a><a href="#FNanchor_513_513"><span class="label">[513]</span></a> Charles Square, Hoxton, was a favourite preaching place of the first
Methodists. The following, taken from the <cite>New Weekly Miscellany</cite>,
pretends to describe one of these preaching scenes: "When the teacher
ascends the place appointed for him, he uses all the gestures of a mountebank,
or posture-master. His constant hearers are frequently about two
thousand,&mdash;all of them the scum of the people, and consisting of near ten
women to one man. Of the rest of the people, some are coming only to
look on, and satisfy their curiosity; and others are going off as soon as
their curiosity is satisfied. Some are laughing, others swearing; some
are selling gin, and others ballads. Some take the opportunity of vending
the printed controversies between Mr. Whitefield and Mr. Wesley; others
are in a maze to see religion brought into such contempt and ridicule by
men in gowns. The houses of the gentlemen living in the Square are
filled with their acquaintances, from the city, as though they had come to
see bears or monkeys. One of the gentlemen said, he would get a French
horn, for his diversion during the time of these preaching performances.
The story took air, and near a hundred of the gang stood before his
house, as if they intended to assault it; while the preacher, in his gown,
looked at the gentleman, and said, 'You unbeliever! you are certainly
damned!'"</p></div>
